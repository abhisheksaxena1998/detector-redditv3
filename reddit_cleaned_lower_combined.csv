5,hat happened to the spiritual country that ndia used to be https  wwwredditcom r india comments ai7392 what happened to the spiritual country that india   t all starts with the relationships we have with our families  the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions reflections on life  aving a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward ndia is a ritualistic country  has always been piritual places people do exist in himalayas  varanasi  arunachal ashrams etc and they still in full glory our position is too simplistic ts the kind of logic one would see on a meme irst of all  this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to ndia merica claims freedom for example ome apanese have tried to argue how the apanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world he ermans claim industriousness  the hinese stability and order and so on hese are ideals  but not defensible under a court of law obody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise  meant only to attack how a country sees itself  and it will win you no favours  however right you may be ext  you dont factor in how much of this spirituality is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism ven a casual look at ndian history does not convince me that spiritualism is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent ot that the hakti movement  the ufi movement  the irasaivites etc did not exist  but that they were quite often not the defining feature of ndian politics or active life here you see the mystical ndia emerge is in ritish writing  and later ndian writers  politicians and reformers trying to separate ndia from estern civilization s late as 1810  ndia accounted for nearly 25 of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp  doubt spiritualism was at play here oreover  this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role ndians have played in history ts far easier to think of a quiet  backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on spirituality and not on technology he far more complicated truth is conveniently left out nd finally  is it all that love and kindness  in the west that has had them bomb every country between audi rabia and ndia s it love that has allowed the  president to call frica a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from muslim countries ven regarding social liberalization  is it love that made the  push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in frica during the  crisis s it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women an urkinis all migrants fleeing terror and war swarms as if they were pests n the words of the lack yed eas here is the loveour view is either myopic or bigoted  in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of western countries than ndia he truth  of course  is that ndia is also becoming more socially liberal nly time will tell  once ndians are as wealthy as mericans what the social landscape in ndia will look like eres the thing n my lifetime ve only seen it get better  dont even defend this characterization of ndia as a spiritual place ndia is anything but spiritual for most ndians who actually live there ts the foreign atrayove crowd  doing hot yoga and sipping erba mate tea who see ndia as this mystical place ort of like the eatles nd ndia in response capitalized on it o me  it is a foreign import ut if thats what ndia wants for the future   think they can go for it gain   dont think for one minute ndia is a better place for the average trans person than the  today  but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love  we should be  and thats just wrong  eligion existed as means to control societies t kept people within tribal groups ave them a code of behaviour and roles to play t made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards lus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand ow we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon e follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals e dont need religion really ow its only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life  piritualism was once indeed an aspect of ndian culture hat generation is long gone oday  spiritualism in the ndian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize  hey we might be losers  but we are spiritual  n reality  we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some estern societies c khaane ko paise nahi  rehne ko room nahi  peene ko daaru nahi  aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi ur tum sprituality ki baatan karte eligious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound eligious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic sexist etc these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not f only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts we wouldnt have so many problems in the first place  ommunal politics  ts an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking countryspecific factors into account1  he est is economically developed vs ndia and has at least 30 years of a headstart ny society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of2  o other country is as diverse as ndia  religion  language  food  culture  race  caste ou name it and ndia has it ow  have nothing against diversity  but from a social perspective  it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development onsequently  when there is no economic progress  social progress is hard to achieve3  ou might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization  but there has been a real change in mindset  at least in the urban areas his is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 2030 years back ven when you look at the   not every state has legalized gay marriagetw  what is your definition of evil he average middle class in ndia have always been like this he spiritual ndia that youre talking about  existed in  amayan and ahabharata  didnt find what was the specific question though   spiritual country my foot et me quote myself that ve written

do  have all legalized cannabis nd our society that does this gatekeeping  have unsurprisingly regressive  controlling and less vibrantll tell you why that isne of the national characters that define

this to you buddy  but you are the third wheelhe sooner you get out  the better it is for you would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible sk her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap y guess is that she will choose the family rom what  gather her parents havent even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break ndian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal et your parents to meet her parents and fix the union   deleted  ve thought of doing this but havent had to  sk her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents nd then eventually bring you into the picture f there is anything ndian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage  its homosexuality  ake the initiative he kind of description youve given   think this approach might work our girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you et her dad on your side  how  use money and respect ddress him as sir  be very respectable  go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion cast he wants ell him youll give her a good life hat could work  or at least will soften himow man to man   wouldnt advice going for a girl who cant stand up to her family  you may somehow marry her today  but her family will be a cause for grief all your life  because there will always be something with themont know all the details though  good luck elcome to casteism  ry watching ride and rejudice for help ame situation  except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love respect etc them  but she will choose the person she marries  me  veryone also told me to forget it and prepare for the worst  but she came through ll you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission nd by no means should you consider yourself any less tll be difficult at first but afterwards  youll laugh about it  n my experience  the only way these types of relationships work is if the ndian involved is strong enough to stand up for him herself to their parents    n other words  ultimately the fight is between her and the parents  not you  ven if you offer her all the support in the world  if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents influence  then  dont think it is worth marrying her  hink about it  hat if down the line  when you are long married  her parents keep interfering in her life and wont stop nd if you have kids  they will insist on raising them this that way and may continue to haggle her over it hey will emotionally blackmail  ndian parents are unfortunately masters at this  until they get their way  oint is  if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now  it will make your life  in the future  o matter how strong a husband you think you are  a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and saving her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children  orry to put it bluntly like that but  feel its the truthhe responsible thing   think  is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you  versus obey her parents  ave an honest sitdown with her and push her into really answering objectively f she is wishywashy  tell her that you will have to leave her because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions   know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other  and are often very gray  but real world consequences  black and white  with very real specific physical mental emotional results  that is why you have to get firm with her   is the one who will have to fight  and if keeping the family statusquo is more important to her  she wont have the strength to do so o matter what happens   let your feelings for her propel you to save her and be her champion  ts almost sure to end badly for you  her  and everybody  t may be painful to break up  but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you dont  o good luck  and remember let it be up to her heres a reason you hardly ever see ndian women with non ndia guys  ou just run smack into it hes just like the majority ost  ndian women simply dont do foreign guys be it tradition  family  culturenlike any other culture marriage in ndia  is an utterly unique  special  watershed event m sure you know this thou re you sure that shes with you because she loves you or is she with you because  in a way  youre exotic for her ell  would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them n many cases  have seen  ndian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely  would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust hat person can put in a good word to make things easiern a lighter note atch ilwale ulhania e ayenge  its a similar situation  to some extent  nderstandably  she does not want tourt her familys standingsause her family grief and painasically get shunned and exiled from her family he ball is in her court he needs to think independently and get this sorted n the other hand    hope she loves you truly and not just because youre from a uropean country or for financial independence ou need to make this very clear lease think twice before you proceed ome ndian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist er parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future m also a  minor victim of this  grandkids have fixed some of the relationships your mileage may vary ell  am late here ut all the best  hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you n the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life    am sorry but thats how they work in ndia  and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them  there are possibilities his would be a harsh test of her character and your patience  but  hope you guys come through lease keep us updated  ove on and break up with her  elp info  where s her family located   hat is her caste  f she not willing to          o let anyone on this planet earth dictate who im going to love or marry,1

12,lder  more experienced people of ndia hat will actually happen if  marry outside my caste https  wwwredditcom r india comments 4qepvz older more experienced people of india what will   ill it really affect my sisters weddingt might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox  backward hat is standing in the society  or prestige o these things actually take a beatinghese things are a state of mind according to me f any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say  y personal experience  married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend  both of us are aharashtrians  y parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart  emotionally tortured my  but she is amazingly strong  did not give up here reasons were also the same as everyone gives  ie what will people say  we will not be able to face the community ventually her parents agreed for marriage took 1 year to convince   after 2 years  think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision t the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids  or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage  did intercaste adventurous  atleast to me  marriage y wife is tambram and i am not here will be problems and bitter feelings initially our first task should be to make babies  not joking here  hat can settle down the dust lso after you marry stay out of sight for some years  hy f you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous tand up for yourself his is your life ont let some 500 year old tradition drive your life ood luck dit stay out of sight  go back to foreign country again   ill it really affect my sisters weddingf arranged marriage  it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldnt want to get married into your family ut do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family hat is standing in the society  or prestige o these things actually take a beatinghis is a tough question  can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence  do note that  live in urban area is south ndiat frankly depends on extended family n the inter caste marriages  have seen  one girls parents were boycotted by extended family for around 23 years etty snarky remarks in family functions  not attending wedding  avoid meeting etc er husbands family  except his mother  came around and rallied around the couple n another couple  know  the guys parents are still pissed off  5 years now  but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged is parents extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs  like wearing mangalsutra   skin color etco if your mom dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and or the extended family is their primary social circle  and the social circle is casteist  their prestige can take a beating owever  you are an adult and you have to live your decision  cant answer this question ut you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about nontrolling answers  f someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldnt be marrying the guy anywayust my 02 rupee ere is what i think    think you are making a mistake eave her nowere is whyf you wanted to be with that girl   absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter o one and i mean no one has a right on your future life ou and your partner have to be the only ones to decide o even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked  i posit that you are not really into herrop it now  not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her onor illing is a possibility heyll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the goats gaus ut seriously uck the orthodoxy f you want ndian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows crew your parents  ot literally  our sister will be fine ts not like shes gonna be married the next day of your own marriage hillarryepent  valuate the fact if the girl is really the one f the answer is yes  other things dont matter ime heals everything and when your parents relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position  diting a few spelling mistakes  ill it really affect my sisters weddinges it will  ajasthan in particular is a bitch about this oth my sisters are arried out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my ad because of this   am not pushing for arriage  my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done  ut the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch  one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family o thats that f you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own  then dont worry hat is standing in the society  or prestige o these things actually take a beatingsshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years  after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing f you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your  then do go ahead and not let the amaj bother you f you are both outside ndia  then why dont you marry there obody will really care in a few years,1

political post politics altogether from this sub our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day nd since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do soou can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like  r indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did   if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they dont comply then ban them from this sub not shadowban let them know why they are banned   d suggest some flairs like arts  sports and religion ore flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably wont downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people +1 for no political twitter spam  emove loweffort political selfpostslease elaborate on thislso  you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your

a place for discussion only or reddit ndia supported activism  or example et neutrality debate  think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl t encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices           think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like  which lead to brigading in real life  houldnt have happened            econd  do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts nd is there a criteria   have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted   see that as an encouragement  oh common account as a mod interestingovernance flair sounds good opefully well have more discussions on that ow about a flair to seperate the faking news unreal times articles from the real news  olitical discussions should be strictly    enforced emove loweffort political selfpostses and yes but we have fallen short because we dont have enough active moderators e would need to hire more he problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do thisny other conditions heeee flairs      jugaad   5      throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop     ut can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion       removed  ou people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didnt work olitics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard   removed  aving to explain memes kind of spoil the fun nd that also kind of deters the content makes  ho am  kidding  no randian makes original content  ven then  atleast its possible in the future and thats how you make a dead subbtw instead of these useless flairs why not make a elhi flair to filter it out all the useless  posts  have a moderation related questions   hen oderators delete a post   have seen 3 kinds of things happening1  comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   2   deleted  message appear on the self post    3 ometimes neither of the 2 happen  but the post still disappears    o whats the difference hy not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation    dd a flair for geopolitics  skndia is good but  dont think overnance flair would be used often ather  have a eekly flair for regular posts nother suggestion  have a   ongress flair along with olitical  lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties  ules rules and more rulest this rate ne day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r ndianolitics   o direct submission to images  including memes  and witter no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense make this rule about unverified twitter handlesverified twitter handles serve as news source  and you have policy of not editing the news headlines  but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts hat defeats the purpose of twitter  as a platform lease could you add a crime flair e get quite a few of those posts  and one for the counselling needed type relationship postsow do you define loweffort political self posts lso what about loweffort political comments in political posts an you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted  can remove the offensive words hx ods can you bring back the weekly movies threadhey were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some timeow with the whole make  r india better thing going on think it would be good time to bring them back  and see how they work nowlus it would also increase semiriginal ontent and  postsaybe stickie those threads early on henever we have one of these posts  it is followed by another list of new rules an we just let things be for a while  lease bring up new ways to help new redditers   deleted    you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules  instead of making shitty new ones ou guys remind me of the following storyhttps  enmwikipediaorg wiki he miller  his son and the donkey  can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that dit just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up ill modmail   egarding no direct submission to images for    posts  could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea oing away with memes and caption this makes sense  but why all images or example  would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation dditionally  if you do decide to go ahead with it  why just images and not audio video ould you clarify what a loweffort political selfpost would be ould all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed f data is to be made mandatory  how would you plan to make sure that the content isnt an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules  deleted  overnance flair is an interesting idea ot sure how much traction it will get but its worth a shot here is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking   am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts  have already expressed my opinion  here  https  npredditcom r india comments 3d8epc is noise drowning out the signal in rindia ct2to3p  and loweffort content is always upvoted to the topsubjective people upvote what they like emove loweffort political selfposts  o direct submission to images  including memes  and witterits censorship mods shouldnt decide what is loweffort and what is not the members of community shouldand not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet    r ndia should not be the place to discuss hatspp forwardseople like it et them decide what they want by uproots downvotes e need more flairs rts  ovies  ooks    etc etc e need weekly threads for different topics an we automate this please  e more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading  see them not tagged rt flairsry and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal verlap and a topic obvious from the nameo for example governance could be policy ntertainment  think would be too broadports is a good choice  think  maybe of value sk is another option  lease take care of posts which are low effort under political flair ont let them shitpost or example like today eally low effort  shit post https  npredditcom r india comments 3dlxn8 proof that rss is literally hitler ne line statements from witter which creates cicrlejerk https  npredditcom r india comments 3dlo0y tell narendramodi to remove his paramilitary from ather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this hat is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politicians we are growing  we are lacking space on the front page  news  politics keep on clogging up that spacelease dont resent anything  be harsh on these assholes ou have my vote on thislease bring more flairs other than skndia elpndia like ports  ntertainment lease have more weekly threads like those tech threads  also sticky those threads so more people comment hanks for taking the initiative  the new flairs sound like a good idea  implementing them  a far bigger proposition  but doable    olitical discussions should be strictly    enforced         his needs to be done  know it is a big task for the mods  but its the need of the hour ou can find people who are actually driven to do this  and if implemented along with removal of low effort self posts  will be a welcome respite  and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub    gain thanks for trying to bring about a change and  wish you guys all the luck to go through with it youll need it   ould we limit the posts with personal questions and rants heyre almost always unverified  troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerksd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting haddis vs tards kind of comments he latter get downvoted pretty often  anyway ould you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvoteight now whenever someone sees something they dont agree with  it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappearsther options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time  used to avoid  r ndia like the plague  but now m starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions  still disagree with some people  but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner  as opposed to the childish  irrational  and chauvinist way people were a while backesubscribed 1 trictly objective rules emove all subjective interpretation from rules his continues the situation of we have fallen short remark hen there is no objectivity  two people can have a different opinion about the same comment  and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion 2 elf posts for images ell  there is already a workaround and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule elf post provides an easier editorializing of the title xactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me 3 ew common account that is purely for communication oes this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public his will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used nless subjective

contributions here already here is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though  public sector jobs  especially police  judiciary and healthcare workers his is important  firstly  because most of our public services are so understaffed here is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance  scant police coverage in most areas  absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country n efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity  healthier  safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy econdly  having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs  especially in the service economy he problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing his is a big problem  believe fully staffing our public services is an investment e dont question the need for physical infrastructure  we shouldnt for well staffed public services lso  its high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past  housing our netas in palatial bungalows  the most expensive real estate in the country ell of utyens elhi babu bungalows  create a fund  invest in human capital  his should be a sticky post

including   are actually made in angladeshf anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price   can create a few jobs in ndia ood start dmins should close the other troll genocide thread ll try to divide my reply in two parts he first where  reply to some of your points and the second where ll try to write up some new parts which you didnt touch on                                                          irst part low but teady estern conomies ccelerated rowth ast siahis is actually somewhat inaccurate s ani odrik and many others have pointed out  there has only been one single path to prosperity for large economies which cant rely on fossil fuels or on tourism like rinidad and obago  hats the path of exportled manufacturing growth ost people mistakenly think this is the ast sian model but this was how the   ermany and rance all developed ame is true with the  anufacturing was a huge part of the  economy up until perhaps the 1970s ome people claim ndia cant replicate this model for two reasons he first is automation   which limits employment opportunity he second is slow trade protectionism ll be brief on boths far as  utomation is concerned  a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs ts just that they were in the factory back in the old days oday everything is hyperspecialised  so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are socalled auxiliary services hey dont get counted with manufacturing today  but they should f they were  job losses arent nearly as bad as its made out to bes for trade protectionism is concerned  its true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times  but historical perspective is needed he average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now orea  aiwan and the other sian tigers as well as reland and some astern uropean nations oland  lovakia etc  had very rapid growth during this period  despite generally low global growth o   think this excuse doesnt really hold today es  the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s  but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average  adly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports t best fabrics and some niches like home textiles e havent been able to crack the apparels segmentur largest textile companies  measured in terms of investment or market cap  are yarn companies or home fabrics companies n footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear  but this beef ban thing could be a detterant   u ringtring your original post is good but  would like to point that hailand   angladesh   alaysia and ndonesia are not under ast sia but under  ew points   here estern dvanced economies like the    undertook economic development in tandem with political development hey did not begin with universal franchise emantic use of the term in tandem is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless  sing such broad terms one can even say that outh orea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed  he fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the est like  esp was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it  where basically no one exists  eaning  no one has ever developed under a democracy nd since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided hings like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric ndia is an older proper democracy than  in this manner   other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights  s for the point on why ndia has underperformed  he fundamental reasons are that ndia has not followed the general path that leads to development here is no niversal model for it but there are certain practices which are nearuniversal meaning they are de facto prerequisite requirements  hings like having an nfrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like ervices and   his a a dynamic which goes even beyond ndustrialization here is no development and stability without nfra development oads were the first things a new empire build  hen at the same time as this is and reforms  its another prerequisite here are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century  verything else comes afterwards ndia is accumulating factors which are exceptional  things like emocracy from the get go  ertiary sector before nfrastructure and reform not even done barring few places like erala  ts no wonder things wouldnt be smooth sailing nd about hat ndia needs   am of a different view ndia should help where the people are and they are in the rimary sector  they are farmers hat is where the labor force is elp them and you solve multiple problems roblems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool roblems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete  exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit  roblems like uprooting people in a country like ndia which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues  elping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck t helps bring the  levels up  it helps the social security dynamic t helps in the balanced development of all majority people argument   urrently though there is no proper model for it nd this is where my views are different than most ndia is already doing things in its own way t is already the exception t should look for new models of growth instead of relying on preexiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage ndia is in o model is universal  they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in ndia should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation   urrently though ndia seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is apid rowth through fast tracked rbanization 10 years back ndian urbanization rate was less than 20  now its reaching mid 30s  o me this goes against the ndia ethos and even practically its not sound for ndia given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources   hen oreans hinese started to make toys to be sold in the west  they never knew they would become some one like this ndian ways of growing is not faulty  it can be considered as a new way e have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and hina orea  gave a lot of importance during early industrializationndustrialization needs infrastructure  skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in ndia e have a pathetic infrastructure ecause the government doesnt want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building  we could not build everything very quickly oads ridges orts ailways are very slow and inefficient ost people will not leave land easily he environment must be protected he contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality ural education is in a very bad condition ost factory workers  construction crew usually come from rural areas n ndia  most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained nefficient governance is also another reason ur state is very backward t takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies ureaucrats usually dont work for people unless someone attacks them aw enforcement is also very bad  his post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold ve been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion hanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion  eading it has been a pleasure ts disheartening that the comments dont have as many points and the ones in the political threads do  ne area prime for reforms and job creation  feel is agriculture  think ndia is employing a huge proportion of its population in farming and yet its very inefficient  maybe the latter is the cause for former  think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation  warehouses and storage  distribution and transportation and food processing his coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semiurban areas be it teachers public transportation workers  support personnels etc anufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing    here estern dvanced economies like the    undertook economic development in tandem with political development hey did not begin with universal franchise his helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weaks far as  is concerned  what period was the capacity weak  when did it become strong  dont think ndia has an  unemployment problem t just has people who dont want to work  ,1

filled with a group of obnoxious uncles who are so giddy about getting laid that they literally cant stop chirping throughout the flighthailand in general tends to attract some absolute shit tier tourists  regardless of nationality h man o there was a huge line in angkok for boarding pass and everybody was standing still in line while some impatient people of my own country literally unhinged the rope from the pole and got in betweenverybody fucking followed and got in the middle he airline crew had to come and maintain decorum he white guys just stood surprised  was at the hicago airport and some elderly women sitting across me at the gate  loudly  in my native language  elugu   started gossiping to each other about what  wearing  sneakers  jeans  a tshirt and a hoodie  fter like a minute or two  told them in elugu  can understand everything theyre saying and to mind their own business and they had the audacity to tell me  dont know how to speak to elders hanging a babys diapers on an empty seat        ve never seen a flight attendant so upset  he had to almost drag the mother to the washroom  where they have babytending facilities  even singing antakshari at night because they thought itd be funnyhat the actual fuck utting into queueus  gets on my nerves every time   omb nikla tohecurity checkins are just a casual formality for him ot broad but an asshole ndian family from abroad spotted at elhi airport  landed from eh and was super hungry and late because my previous flight landed late his family argues on the counter while taking boarding pass asking for a free upgrade pon asking why sir  ave you bought an upgrade  heir reply was actually were from  henever  go to india from okyo to elhi via hailand  the difference between the two legs of the journey is huge ad gone to witzerland and there were a lot of ndians n ungfraujoch  there was this middle aged guy who shouted in the loudest voice ve heard    veryone looked at him but he didnt give a shit ince he was evidently not going to apologize   went and did the good deed omeone from the same group was trying to score a mini bottle of ed abel for free even though you had to pay for it heir argument was that we have bought so much food  we should get one for free ventually the cashier got hella pissed and refused to serve them hen  read the the rules that the wiss hotel had put up   wasnt surprised hats not racism people  a lot of travelers are just rude and entitled his didnt happen to me  but when my  was flying to ubai  there was a middleaged ndian man who was sitting next to her  with one seat gap between them  e straight up grabbed food from my s meal saying dont mind no e also proceeded to fight for more free alcohol after having like some four pegs before was glad there was a seat between him and my  and she got out safely but man  you tend to meet some really creepy people on flights have also seen ndian families just walk to plug points in airports and proceed to remove other peoples charging paraphernalia just like that  without asking them and then put their own chargers there fter that  they proceed to beg saying please please and then hog that port until the end of time hy is it that as indians we hate to see other indians when we visit some place touristy s it just me  hen  go some place and see indians there  get upset and think oh no these fuckers are here too  n my flight back from eathrow to dubai final destination ndia   there was an ndian lady with her son  sitting on my window seat which  had booked as soon as check ins opened he said with such entitlement to me that you can sit on the aisle seat idnt find it decent to say anything or maybe  didnt have the right words at the moment   settled into the aisle seat fter sulking within for 10 minutes   asked her to move back to her seat might have given the seat had she asked politely but the attitude he antakshari point made me cringe inside out iterally  everytime  get on a flight o or from the us to india  there are obnoxious ndians  who either block the boarding gates even for disabled passengers hile getting off the plane  they dont care if their luggage is banging others and will run over others in front of them he worst part is when the steward   stewardess bring drinks hey try to hog drinks like its holi 1 he irst ne ut game that we guys play as soon as the flight has landed e all are used to seeing this but its fun to see the faces of foreigners new to this experience2 rinking beyond limits just because its free  another thing that we frequently see on nternational flights 3 ot seen most ndians doing this but have still seen a considerable amount breaking queue everywhere possible  be it coffeshops  grocery stores  airport lines  toilets as fun to see our fellow countrymen breaking queues for ube ickets and the nglishmen just shaking their heads or muttering to themselves since they are too polite for their own good 4 ave seen a full blown fight between an ndian group of 7 to 8 and a akistani group of nearly the same size in a  pub t happened because a guy from one of these groups was acting fresh with a lady from the other  dont know if these individuals were on esidents though  police had to be involved hhhhhh od there are so many  bunch of gujju aunties being reprimanded by an security officer at airport toilet  pparently they had deviced an unique strategy   where woman who is using the washroom would lock the door with one leg so the next one can go inside after her without paying for each individual use  ike this 8 or more women used to go at same time  hey had absolutely no shame on their face   nor do their husband  n the contrary   they seemed proud of the unique idea   even heard one of them saying proudly madam   expert hehy do such people  even travel urope   ustralia etc for vacation  ot on a flight from bu habi to hmedabad in which  was on the window seat next to an elderly gentlemen on my right e had come before me and once  sat down he started to complain about how unethical and disgraceful it was that the flight had put him next to a girl  lol e moaned and moaned until a younger gentlemen sat in front between two men asked him to swap seats o this is in ydney veryone takes the train to get back to the suburbs in the evening nd its also well known that the train network is complicated  and a signal issue  or a medical emergency at one station can create delays and a backlog for hours  rains run every 23 min during peak hours  uring one such day a signal issue at a station meant that every train going in that direction was delayed for an average of 15 min very signal was turning green slower than it would he train  was in was later on and was also majorly affected e were delayed by 30 min  and the train was stopping every now and then waiting for the signals he train driver kept announcing frequently that hes waiting for the signal and thats why we arent moving lso said orry for the inconvenience even though its not his fault hen the train stood for long at a platform hed open up the doors and say passengers are welcome to stretch out on the platform  and hed inform when hes ready to leaveuring one such stoppages and ndian uncle got pissed e were in the first compartment e got down at the platform and started shouting at the driver for the delay e said things like ou may drive a train   have more important things to do  and its because of people like you  trains are always late he driver was patient and just repeated that he cannot move until he gets his signal ncle was not happy ept screaming  and said do you think m a fool n ustralian gentleman told him he was a fool and asked him to shut up and defended the driver #x200 nd then ncle says y wife will scold me for coming late he entire compartment laughed out loud and ncle lost his voice after that aale sab dusron ko dosh de rahe hain  apne girebaan mein koi nahin jhaank raha hai veryone is blaming others  no one is introspecting to identify the mistakes they made themselves will tell a story where  was the idiot entitled one irst time  went to    went to my hotel to checkin he woman at the reception was talking to another customer here was a slight pause in their conversation and instinctively  thought this is my opening and barged in he immediately stopped me with  orry sir   am talking to this gentleman here hat was the first time  realized that you are supposed to wait for your turn patiently n the other hand  when  came back to ndia  it became evident that this wont always work in ndia because if you politely and patiently wait for your turn in ndia  your turn will never come y worst experience was in inland last year  was there on an exchange program with my school and my friends and  were in a club  was getting a drink at the bar and this ndian dude came up to me and started asking me shit like  aar firangi ladki ke saath baat karunga to chodegi kya  told him not be a dick pparently he was there for a business thing and he worked for okia e started asking me to set him up with some of my female friends  none of them are ndian so he thought this was his chance   squarely told him to fuck off and not to embarrass himself hen  stepped out for a bit to take a call while my friends were inside hile  was outside a female friend of mine came outside to tell me that apparently some ndian dude was bugging them and he claimed to be my friend  ran back in to tell him to fuck off but by then the bouncers had already gotten to him hey asked me if  knew him and  told them everything that happened hey asked me to leave anyway but my friends kinda stood up for me t was embarrassing as fuck so  left anyway he fucked up part was that  that guy wasnt even drunk e was just a fucking choot as on an ir ndia flight heading to europe here was a family with a kid whose diaper was soiled and  was stinking badly  obviously  he kid was still sitting on the seat ut thats not all hen the air hostess intervened  the father of the child casually said  o  no its fine e will land in 2 hours anyway he most common thing among desis in estern countries is buying stuff with the express intent of returning  using any have turned it into an art form  what to say  how to appear belligerent  how to abuse the system shamelessly  etc hankfully  the s  next generation  are thoroughly embarrassed and want nothing to do with their parents shenanigans  few recent incidents1  d been to ellowstone with family and there are these pools there which have a high concentration of bacteria and they shouldnt be disturbed for ecological reasons here are  signs saying acterial pool mats  please do not touch  but despite this  noticed some full grown adults that were a part of a huge ndian group touch and splash the water around f not for the sake of the environment  at least have the common sense to not touch water that is literally filled with bacteria he most embarrassing scene was when this young hinese child who was also a part of the tourist group shyly point to the sign and say no no that these adults noticed and didnt pay heed to d finally had enough and approached these people and asked them to move away from the water because they werent allowed to touch it after which they reluctantly moved ooking at this scene this old white guy who was walking by mumbles ucking tourists 2  heres a park near my place where kids play and adults walk around in the evening t the same time this huge group of aunties  m guessing housewives convene near the play area which is usually so silent and peaceful and start a racket loudly in indi unjabi  while their kids play aughing and gossiping about random things its such a nuisance o ones asking them not to talk  but maybe call your friends home and host the racket  will never understand why its so difficult for people to just fit in and behave like people around them he hy fit in when  was born to stand out quote has been taken too literally some some of them havent seen too many people misbehave here though what annoys me more is how they behave like law abiding decent citizens here and the second they return to ndia  throw garbage around  and behave badly ou come here and see how clean and beautiful everything is and after living here for a while  they sure as hell know how to maintain such a place  then why do they behave badly when they get back ecause h its already dirty  nobody follows the rules anyways  everyone honks anyway so why shouldnt  do the the same  guy yelling at the ir hostess for not helping with his bags is reason he has heart issues and its her duty e was so proud bitching about her the whole way that  felt so bad being an ndian e even complained about her to all her coworkers ever been abroad  so no stories to add here but that last one hurt ell  live in ingapore but  swear ndian tourists mostly  when alighting from the plane in either countries or even other countries as a matter of fact  are in such a hurry like the doors are not open have some patience pleaselso not to mention the loud talking f u understand an ndian language u can easily know what they are talking about 1 irports lways orst one was at harles e aulle  a flight to ndia  and the passengers had crowded the boarding gate  and were not willing to go sit down and line up according to groups he gate staff were initially nice  then they got a bit firm  but the passengers were not relenting he crew had to finally bring out the pilot or copilot  who was a ikh ndian  who had to yell at them in indi to sit  and behave orderly  or they would hold up boarding2 alking around some markets in unich with my husband  we were minding our own business his desi looking uncle  with his wife and

paid 20 to ensure an aisle seat  and she could have it if she gave me 30 4 f you sit in the back of the plane on a flight to ndia  you will notice  the red label will never reach you he uncles will always finish it before service is over aving said that  this ridiculous  entitled behaviour is almost always uncles and aunties ve met some really nice people in their 20s and 30s who always talk about general things  offer travel advice and share their experiences  always have problem with north indian groups traveling abroad hey are very loud in flight and they look down on elugu amil people nd also their funny nglish accent on a flight to urope is more cringy   maybe  newly married couple complained about their pizza having only tomato sauce and cheese and none of the other toppings we get at ominoes or izza ut t a pizzeria       deleted  1 n a flight to ingapore an oldie unty  5055 years  and a middle aged man  ate 30searly 40s  start chatting loudly in what sounded like arathi to my northern ears his was after the meals had been served and lights turned off on a 12 hour flight  few old ustralian passengers who were trying to sleep asked them as politely as one can to speak a little less loudly he old lady went nuts with the usual e have also bought a ticket  we will talk as we likeblah blah he other passengers just pay back on their seats as if resigning to their fate  dont know why they didnt call the flight attendants 2 here is loud and then there is unjabi loud  and  know this because m one  unjabi unty in the seat ahead of mine talking loudly over the phone  telling the person to take in her kachera  unjabi for kuccha underwear  on the washing line because it seemed like it was going to rain his was just before takeoff and she didnt shut up until the stewardess asked her to 3 n a athay acific flight full of ndians travelling from ongong to elhi a ikh uncle  mid late 30s  probably from elhi asked the stewardess to carry his duty free wine in her luggage so he didnt have to pay any duty on the load of alcohol he was carrying he rest of the passengers were such a pain as well  as they kept walking around and not sitting down even after the pilots announcement that they were about to land ne guy kept trying to access his carry luggage when the seatbelt sign was on  for some reason until the male steward gave him a firm talk he stewardesses were holding their heads in their hands any such stories but if you are one of the more enlightened ones  please go out of your way to change this image of uncouth  loud and rude ndian traveller t might not be your making but it affects you as much as it will affect the people who are responsible for it y worst flight ever  my personal flight from hell  aris to umbai  ecember 14th  2003  took  from hicago to aris  what  didnt know was the  flight was also hicago to aris with a layover in aris hen  got on  a gujju lady was beside me with her granddaughter he made a make shift camp bed infront of our legs for her kid m 62  it was impossible for me to move s a meek 17 year old then   didnt say a word  not that it would matter anyway  she didnt know indi  first time  realised not all ujarati people speak indi  even filled out their immigration leaflet before deboarding  worked at a hotel in auritius for an year  surprisingly not many entitled ndian stories  even though 50 of our guests were ndian y opinion1 ure overreaction  cant point this as ndian behaviour2 ghh   hate such idiots3 nly beatings can cure such things4 ay be only such people get a pass to be there5 hile many country tourists are stereotyped for their behaviour and this one is just typical ndian ndian family in an merican restaurant they act like they are entitled to everything and act they literally own the restaurant  work in a fine dining restaurant and we have jazz music every ednesday he family walked in demanded ndian classical be played by the band  his is why most servers dont want an ndian table in restaurant and they wont tip no matter what as flying back from europe  had two inbreds in the seat behind me hey realised that alchohol on the flight was free and proceeded to hound the air hostess for drinks for the first 23 hours hen once drunk they started watching videos on their phone without headphones fter a couple of minutes other passengers complained to the staff and they finally stoppedfter a few hours of nonsense like this  one of the apes decided that 8 glasses of airplane whiskey didnt agree with his stomach and decided to puke all over the aisle o for the last 4 hours of my flight  had to deal with the stench of stomach acid and partly digested airplane food #5 had it been in   both of those clowns wouldve been dragged out for some special interrogation  was in ustralia for an onsite projectn the community gym  there was this particular indian women who used to bring her 23 year old grand kids to the gym  hese kids were quite a nuisance

hyderabad one guy standing in 10th row was pushing everyone to get ahead as soon as the plane landed  tried to stop him but he pointed to his wife   let him go thinking she was unwell hen i got down i saw him clicking selfies with his wife in front of the bus ets be honest  all countries nationalities are assholes ust see how white people go to developing countries and beg for us to fund their finding themselves trip know its a lil whataboutism  but other countries already hate us ust see how white people on eddit are very quick to point out that we smell of urry and spices  when they themselves cant properly clean their asses and smell of poop  bidet masterrace toiler paper eriously  dont get into this self hate thing ajority of ndians are respectful  its basically numbers game f 10 of uk is annoying  thats 6 million f 10 of ndia is annoying  thats 150 million ve seen a lot of us haggle the people from customer service for free upgrades meals discounts he game plan is simple  doesnt matter if its flight or a hotel or any other place in the hospitality industry hey go in with the cheapest plan ticket reservation and then look for some god damn stupid reason to complaint to the customer service reps hey wont stop stop complaining arguing till they get something free  it could be a better room  better seat on a flight  free meal anything nd the worst part is that once they get something free of cost they will go and brag about this to their friends and family as if they did something great ts so annoying listening to people and their cheap adventures umber 3 as mentioned by   legit happened to me and a friend  the first time we were in attaya we were turned away from a couple of establishments and when it made sense that this is because of being ndian we were extremely shocked e had no other option but to show ustralian  and currency we were carrying to show that we came from ustralia henever  made friends with foreigners online they would  without fail  comment on how different  am from the ndians they see ts an easy halo effect  so  dont mind his was from oli last year here is a very nice little stretch in ersey ity     one in the kal ho na ho   and its really nice to just sit out there and look at the  skyline at sunset magine my horror to see holi colors all over the deck and its just not isolated  there was pichkari stains and gulal and it was just disgusting  mean fucking play holi but clean up after your mess t was really disappointing to see that there are so inconsiderate people ong line at immigration point at elsinki irport  pair middle aged woman and man pushing and showing through the line to get in front loudly proclaiming we are senior citizens ith that stupid hand gesture and head wobble s if being senior citizen means something in candinavia et a bloody free wheelchair if you cant stand or walk oing down from ugspitze  ermany by cable car  this huge group of middle aged ndians shouting on top of their voices  ows the joshigh sir as super embarassing to share the cable car with them smh lol this thread is depressing  was on my flight from eddah   to ew elhi nce on board flight attendant started handing out blankets to anyone who have asked s soon he started distributing literally every ndian around started shouting on him ir ji me  sir mujhe bhi  me me  here  sir here etc it was so loud that it make everyone uncomfortable t this point the flight attended said in indi   hai  yeh khana nahi hai uess what  attendant was ussian ve got something similar on three occasions 1 ve travelled every year of my life since  was born as my parents lived and worked abroad o  ve witnessed all sorts of chaos and woe that ndians occasionally  bring in flights and the regular things like standing in the aisle even before the plane has come to a stop etc remember recently on a flight from the middle east a few people got up and made a queue before the seatbelt signs were turned off and the plane was still moving ne man sitting near the door  told them to stop making the queue so early and they said weve been waiting to return to ndia for a few years and he responds quickly  ab saalo wait kar liya to do minute me kya jaiga tumhara aith jaiyen a few flights  d see people bring in luggage greater than the weight allotted to them and in order to evade the extra baggage fee  theyd stall the line for boarding pass and ask if they can checkin their luggage with us as we generally packed light for frequent travel f weve had reached our luggage limit and politely refuse  theyd ask the next guy in line2  was returning via bus from  to  and there was written baggage limitation on the bus ticket of two bags t was also explicitly mentioned in bold red that no leeway would be given for extra baggagehen comes this news reporter and her mother with six huge suitcases veryone has handed over their luggage and got it stored in the storage of the bus  was travelling with an ndian friend at the time  we had one suitcase each ere queuing up to get onto the bus and shes there arguing with the bus conductor e refused to entertain them e told them to either get on the bus or get offhe then seeing us in the queue comes to us and asks if we have luggage left to checkin  agreed as it was delaying the bus departure and she got her wayhen we went to the bus conductor he looked at us and then said that every time an ndian would come and theyd always exceed the luggage limit and we shouldnt let her get her way  said  were also ndian and if we have space  then do this once and we can depart quicklye made the reporter promise to the conductor that shed not check in more luggage on her return journey he got all happy and gave us her business card  a reporter for some big ews  corp e didnt care ut  the delay she caused in departure made everybody very angry with us y friend even said  aane do inko hasne do ndia smajh baithi hain ye log3 his one was unique  here was a guy adamant about smoking aboard the plane while in flight light attendants and people will keep telling him to stop ed put out the cigarette and then light it again after some time he flight attendant snatched his lighter he was hiding and cigarettes sked for his passport and visa e was then promptly arrested upon disembarkation as soon as he was through the immigration checklease  everybody  when you travel  make sure you read the rules on the tickets ahead of the journey heres been quite a few occasions when  witnessed ndian travelers acting really stuck up and entitled and treating service personnel like crap  though that mostly applies to the middle income crowd  ry flying business or first class and every ndian passenger would make an average esterner look like an uncivilized savage  witch to cattle class and everyone acts like theyre one of the reat ughals and demands theyre treated as such e were in thens boarding the metro from the airport to the city ince it was the first station  the train was stopped till its departure time n ndian uncle was standing near the open door  just outside  and smoking t least two announcements were made saying that the train is about to depart  so please board his guy just put one leg inside the train and waited hen the doors started shutting  and he tried to claw the door open  multiple times ince the doors werent shut  the train couldnt leave  and he wasnt strong enough to claw them open completely e finally managed to wriggle his leg outside  and the train was able to leave here is a statue called he ittle ermaid in openhagen  enmark  saw grownup ndians trying to climb the statue  not too tall  to pose for a picture as on a flight from ubai to  and had a bunch of elugu uncles  they tiskocheezekoed their way to cowboy land  in the row behind me hey really were having a ball and seemed to be first time travellers based on the way they were trying to enjoy everything to the hilt hat really irked me was the way they would keep calling the hostesses  we were sitting very close to the pantry area  so they would just hail  ye  babbyy  waater waater or ye  bebbie  3 beers or ye  babbee  some chicken nuts aa since they wanted their drinks and chakna on their laps whenever their hearts desired ne of them would replace babbyy with medam  medam nd do note  they didnt seem to use those words deridingly  no followup laughter and all   they just seemed to know that those were the words to refer to a nondesi woman hat baffled me most was how the hostesses seemed to be completely okay with those calls and would respond to them every time with smiles and actually even serve them what they wanted ll that just confused and irritated the shit outta me and  did nothing but just sulk urger hai bhaijaan  bomb nahin would also be an appropriate line to say after one rips out a nice fat one  which is quite common from our countrymen and women on such long flights  what with all the airline food and beverages floating inside ndian uncles and aunties eating iryani  oti  urd rice  emon rice in  near the charging bull statue hats the worst thing  have ever seen because lot of other tourists come to that place hats wrong with sharing a beer an the first story made me so mad  hy doesnt the  start banning these entitled fucks from flying  few years ago me and my father were at this pizza place in rizona where you need to put your own boxes in the trash and we saw this massive ndian family just leave everything on the table and then go t was so embarrassing the staff looked very incensed y dad went over and apologized for their behaviour here was a time when  came to know  was the idiot  o  was just walking in a town in outh ast sia and  saw a girl selling fruit salad   just said  her get me one in a loud tone just like we do in ndia and she was pissed like anything   realised my folly when  saw a aucasian couple buying the same stuff with so much civility  hen you are travelling in a group   the whole group is as civil as the most uncivilised person  e went to a rench bakery and they had this number plate on table system  ur girls went so crazy with selfies   food pics etc   it was literally a ommotion  rench staff was really kind and just pointed out that please make sure that number is visible o be honest   these white people overdo stuff o much of hank ou but we need to be more humble as well  was on a flight from umbai to bu habi  flying the new  at that time  tihad irbus 380 which is basically a double decker he bottom  think was all economy and the top was business and the really fancy first class apartment style seats  lot of people in economy were really curious to see the apartment style seats and asked the crew to allow them to go up there and they were obviously denied since that would disturb the passengers up there hen we reached   everyone had to exit to the front of the plane where there also happened to be stairs to the top  flight attendant was standing there to ensure that noone strayed to the top s  was exiting  right in front of me was an ndian man with his perhaps 8 year old son e could hear the attendant telling a lot of people on their way out that they wouldnt be allowed up there  so even though  was curious myself   had decided  wouldnt ask to go up s we got to where the attendant was standing  someone from the other aisle asked him a question and he turned to deal with them he man in front of me  seized this opportunity to try and sneak past the attendant e started climbing the stairs along with his son and had one eye on the attendant the whole time to make sure he didnt turn he attendant did of course  soon turn  and had to give this man a dressing down t was soo embarrassinga grown man getting told off in front of his son for not being able to listen to simple instructions  as if they apply to everyone but him   ell  mine must be the battery ark in new ork ity ll of us are waiting in line  when a ujarati family  a old batshit crazy mother and her two sons decide that they are too good to be waiting with us peasants  so they literally go under the tape only to be stopped by security and given a surprise insert surprised ikachu face that theyre in the nited tates  not ndia hen the sons try to cuss and scream at the female security guard  theyre probably not frequent tourists and havent got accustomed to the concept of female security guards  about random stuff and how theyre gonna sue her of all shes worth he calmly calls the cops on them and they are dragged away in a  police car  with handcuffs  while the whites are muttering stuff about ndians under their breath  and my girlfriend and  are praying to whatever od exists that we look non ndian enough  and start talking in apanese for everyone to hear hat  find frustratin,

46, skndia  s it just me or are most of the gym trainers across our nation unqualified https  wwwredditcom r india comments bxsezi askindia is it just me or are most of the gym   ve trained for 55 years in   hopping gyms every 612 months ve been to some cheap gyms   800 month  and been to some relatively expensive chains  bomiso  anytime fitness  and one thing is pretty common  the trainers all suck   n fact  in my experience  the most knowledgeable gym trainer ve met was at the cheapest gym  he owned the gym  and was running it in the basement of an actual residence   eres how ve learnt to deal with the pseudotrainers   1 ake them know their place heyre there to help you if and only if you ask for help ouve paid for the membership  which means you can use the equipment oure under no obligation to listen to trainers   2 e courteous  but distant with them ay  have my routine  m doing this any trainers will just leave you alone  thinking you already have another plan  or know more than them  which is actually very probable   3 ollow your routine to a   so you can impress the same guys with your results  in silence   est of luck ve been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free   can confirm that majority of trainers dont even know the names and proper form of exercise et alone talking about compound and isolation exercises yms dont have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body hats just exercise ost of the people dont even know about nutrition and stuff hey will just point you to the nearest supplement counter he deadlift one is actually correct ts called a mixed grip  it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping ou need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you dont develop muscle imbalance ts damn hot  can you turn on the   ts good if its hot  youll sweat more so become thinner  png  got lucky when  started going to gym where there was a trainer in his 40s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in 2010 nd now in angalore these trainers literally doesnt even know to teach pushups in correct form e careful when you choose to join a gym ny should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life ude   have been lifting for 3 years and have even helped my friends in transformation till now  have not seen a single trainer or even a competitor who knows his shit  have even trained with r and he doesnt know shit about training hese people are complete jackass  ost of these guys use s told to them by some trainer and then suffer ou can check tarun ills channel on ouube and not even 1 competitor knew his shit 1 of them was telling to stop bathing before competition  deleted  ve been to 3 gyms in angalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers dont know shit  would have got tendinitis if  continues with the cult fitness class o be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained his is the pain which comes with a growing nation or instance  try looking for a handyman who is competent ts really hard  or they are already working for a big company he money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they dont put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better opefully with growth of economy our countrys workforce skills also grow up  used to go to a gym for a while  201415  and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause m too skinny ptimum nutrition rue that  lot of trainers focus on unnecessary things or sound phony asf rom what ve seen  ult seems to carry some good trainers with good certificationsost of all  all the trainers that ve visited or seen are self made  they built a good body and then became a trainer because of the money o they dont exactly know the scientific way but the way that worked for them ither way   see most ndians go through a lot of ouube channels and blogs and pick what suits them best y buffy buddies are all from the same method  have gone to some form of gym for the past 45 years or 2 years  when  went to the normal gym   was doing squats wrong and no one told me about this   dont know if it is because they didnt know or because of not giving a fuck since they are underpaid   nd many of them focus on isolation exercises and not compound or functional exercises which is a huge problem  went to a functional fitness  not crossfit but similar  gym 3 years ago and that is where  came to know about quats  eadlift etc ut here too  the main trainer knows his stuff well while others do not hese trainers are also trying to sell either protein powder or dietician none of which  wanted his is because they are earning about 1525k per month  which is quite less for the amount of hours they put in tbh  hese trainers make their money from personal training and hence maybe the lack of interest that you see around nother important thing that all gyms across the country lack is their ignorance of cooldown ost gyms do not focus on cooldown while those that do  do not spend more than 10 mins  learnt it the hard way by going to the physiotherapist and spending 5k for rehabilitation urrently   go to the gym in my building itself the trainer there is good  but doesnt know enough compound exercises   if you are looking at only fitness and have no huge goals  you can workout at home itself because there are a lot of online channels posting workout videos ll you need is a pair of dumbells  and a mat ave been lifting for over 6 years  this should come as no surprise to you  theres no regulation nfortunately youre going to have to do your own homework on the internet and use your head to navigate the broscience hile  lived in bombay  used to go to itrro  the membership was quite steep but the trainers knew their stuff there ut for the most part elsewhere  for sure  clueless ertified trainers anywhere in the world will cost a fortune have been working out for a long time without a trainer  using my own routine and have had fairly good results recommend sites such as scoobys workshop  funny name but totally worth it  and the forums of bodybuilding dot com he thing to keep in mind is that it takes time to build muscle and get sustainable results here is no quick solution and any person giving quick results is either a liar or will end up hurting you es s with all fields in ndia which are technicalf any of you want to learn to lift or whatever  just go to  https  startingstrengthcom   https  startingstrengthcom   elcome bro  use im wendlers routine which you can find online or buy his book nd use my trainer mostly as a spotter so that  dont go bad form and break my back  think thats the best way to use ndian trainers and yes creating a routine and dieting wise they all suck according to me his really depends on the franchise gym you go to #x200 ackground   used to go to olds gym in hennai  think it was the first branch they opened in the country  and the trainers were all top notch ven in avericks   now   think  the trainers knew what they were talking about  and a good proportion of them were looking to get further certifications in the fitness industry #x200  suppose its a pretty banal case of you get what you pay for he fitness industry  like a host of other industries  that have arrived in ndia needs some time to mature  suppose he bonus isnt that bad ros usually deadlift with a mixed grip  it prevents the bar from slipping too much when compared to a double overhand grip hats because when the bar starts to roll out of one hand  it rolls into the otherere are things the trainer at my gym said   dont pay him  hes the owner too 1 eavy weights build size and no strength2 o light weights with 25+ reps for fat loss3 at exercises reduce love handles4 ide bends reduce love handleseople  know have had it worse than me heir trainer made them do all machine workouts the first day  and full body workout every day for a month or so nd they went to posh gymso yes  ndian trainers are pretty bad ainly because we dont have the level of education here which is possessed  or required to be possessed  by someone of that nature ost here follow broscience of shock the muscle he trainer at my gym doesnt even know what tarting trength and 5 3 1 are arming up has a lot of different connotationsarming up with lighter weights to practice form before the lifts hats goodarming up by running on the treadmill for 10 minutes then practicing judo kicks for the next 10 before you actually pick up weights ot productive ow to detect a bad trainer  sk his opinion on leg curls and upright rows f he approves of either of these  hes a bad trainer epends have been going to old ym for last 4 years  and the one  train under is greatut it sucks for the wallet he body shape of most gym trainers in ndia says everything it has to about untrained gym trainers in ndia ym trainers in ndia are basically people who have spent a shit load of time in or around gyms  have seen quite a few trainers who dont know much but have somehow built a good physique  but there are also others  have met who  know their shit as well as the science behind building muscles  something like the thlean  guy m never gonna forget the way one of them described chest exercises to me  the way theyre supposed to be donewhat people do wrong etc nfortunately that person rarely offers personal training and owns the gym lol oes anyone here know how good the cultfit classes are specially the boxing classes  eadlifts ne palm grips front  one grips reverse aan  jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho have seen guys do that whats the logic of doing that  have foudn vice versa also  many people are not even willing to listen to sound advice  since sound advice requires working on form and technique eople in my gym do half squats without wanting to put in effort to master below parallel depth ome do close grip bench with very close grip  fuck wrists ift arms all the up top in dumbbell rows nd despite my reasoning  some of these are friends   most just stay on  since they can lift heavier weights this way with poor form eople however flock to model trainer in my gym who looks better than me    dont know where you live but i live in vasai and in my local gym there are certified trainers  have been training for more than 7 years  ost of the trainers  who are certified are always looking for clients because they earn more throught clients than spending more amount of time being employed inthe gym y advice is do your research f you are willing to invest time and money in the gym you should invest some time in picking up a routine and progressively overload ost trainers suck hey offer diet advice even when they know they are not supposed to hey dont understand that rep range depends upon fitness and advice 15 reps to everyonethe good thing is ve met some good trainers hey dont try to force their methods on everyone  lucked out way back in the day and ended up with a high level powerlifter as a trainer e was into heavy lifts  low reps and a  of rest in between sets  lucked out in joining the gym t was cheap  great equipment  empty most of the time so the trainer had nothing else to do but chat with me and give fitness tips ow  a lot going on here  have been trying to get fit and get regular at a gym but  dont know what should  do  am not experienced with the equipment and gym instructors only help out in the initial few days of joining a gym ny ideas where  can learn the movements and how to do them safely  d like to avoid injury at all costs   have tried watching tutorials on youtube but it there is too much noise there to make senseful plan ymming veterans please help guide me   eadlifts ne palm grips front  one grips reverse aan  jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale hohis one is correct advice  but you dont need to do this for lower weights s you stack more weights  the chance of slipping goes up lso  when you lift the plates can spin a little because both your wrists are facing the same direction he momentum can be enough to cause the barbell to spin out from your hand   ive seen lot of brosciency stuff even in the west rainers who keep updating their knowledge are the best ones nes who havent will tell you its ok to do lat pull downs behind your neck like they used to 20 years ago nytime fitness here pays general trainers like 10k for 8 hours shifts  good occasionally competing trainer eats 3040k  a month  enior trainers are also some 36 months certified ones with 23 years of lifting experience#x200 ut this thing is fading with the ecoms and these new ndian youtubers like eet alal  aurav aneja  ybollywood ody  uru mann  angram hougule  ahil han etc o these trainers nowadays are mainly just for spotting weights or running an illegal steroid cycle hat gyms have you heard these from upporter nhi phnega toh chhota ho jayega  paani bhar jayega  have learned the proper forms  techniques and workouts from ouube up they are hey also practice the worst bro science and will just take juice to get their body f you wanna join a fitness and health discord server to discuss gym  supplements  diet share your progress etc https  discordgg ugh  deleted  r right hats the case with 90 percent of the trainers hese guys are filled with bro science and have at some point in their life and or currently taken steroids  to get their body where it is now hese idiots also peddle steroids   growth hormones   growth hormone releasing peptides to young naive gym goers to help reach the ideal instagrammable physique ff late these dumb fuck trainers have discovered muscle building content on youtube via fake natties and sellouts  further fuelled with social media and popular forums and are again peddling misinformation and bad plans to people  here seems to be no end to this chutiyapa eople need to have thier eyes opened to the right information es  deleted   deleted  arebeecom for routines and freeweight exercises his is very true ne guy who used to train in our gym for a few years off and on has now become a trainer for a reputed gym brand   wont say the name as  dont want him to get in trouble  part from the fact that he weighs barely more than a feather  we know that he doesnt know a thing about exercises  let alone nutrition and stuff o  yeah  thats bound to happen lso  most of them force you to increase the weight  without asking you to do so progressively  infact they dont even care about form  which is really important atio of gym patrons with fit bodies to unfit bodies is surprisingly high at my gym d think the trainers do a good job here hy would you call yourself a bad trainer  started training in 2014 and have been training for the better part of last 5 years in yderabad  have been to multiple gyms from cheap to the expensive ones ore fitness  n my experience most of the gym trainers that i have met and conversed with dont know anything about training and bodybuilding ost of trainers that i have encountered are just a bunch of guys who trained for a few years using s and steroids being completely clueless about basics of training  supplementation and  nutrition nfact  most of them are just there to sell you products like protein powders  s  reatine and that too fake ones ven most of the youtubers present in ndian bodybuilding community like ohit hatri  arun ill etc do not provide science based empirical studies and evidence behind their exercises and videos and is just bro science  personally find youtubers like eth eroce  outube  https  wwwyoutubecom channel kuxd6bcjhw   and  eff ipard  outube  https  wwwyoutubecom user icecream4s    the best in the industry when it comes to sharing knowledge relating to supplements  exercises  importance of warmups  gear amongst other things  have learnt the most from their youtube channels amongst all the youtubers that i used to follow#x200 #x200  few of my personal favourite eths videos houlder workout   https  youtube th03d8t4  https  youtube th03d8t4 #x200 teroids   https  wwwyoutubecom watchv h2nqn  https  wwwyoutubecom watchv h2nqn  amm  have been working out since 2016 and all the knowledge  have is from the internet cause the trainers  have met dont know shit ts good to see educated gym goers like you guys who actually give a shit about things like form  compound movements proper warmup etc  hope  can meet some of you in real life someday and share the love for working out  beginner 17 here with 95g weight nybody can help suggest me something uys    agree with mostly all of you ut koi mujhe yeh batao ki original supplements aur ahi rates ai kaha milenge lipkart aur mazon pe ai chutiya katwa chuka hu n a completely different note  have you tried training with kettlebells he stuff will turn you into a beast m never going back to isolation workouts oure not alone with this kind of experience his is an example of a job that can pay better in ndia than outside of ndia  knew an merican who made excellent money gym training in umbai  better than he would have back in the  l r version of my answer is yes y trainer is completely aversive to suggest supplements but gives some bs advices at times he most ridiculous being his diet charts ollow the r fitness wiki and the website exrxnet s someone who is deciding to make a career in fitness  starting as personal trainer   hich institute do you guys suggest  o far ve heard of

49, skndia  erious  s it worth attempting immigration to anada  ustralia for 16lpmers in ndia https  wwwredditcom r india comments c4ilk5 askindiaserious is it worth attempting    with a fairly neutral opinion hereome ons that arent always sharedxpect a much quieter social life  a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children  a reduced sense of selfidentity  a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress fcourse youll have more money after immigrating but it wont feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees f you enjoy a more selfinvolved lifestyle  itll be easier to adjust f youd like  d be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions  my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea hat  mean by that ith just two months of salary in anada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch    a sound bar and a nice couch ne year into job you can afford a muscle car like amaro or ustang  with loan ofcourse  ou can also meet ndians and make new ndian friends by going to temples or other ndian group meeting that you look up on acebook ut if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends  dont really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then anada might be boring ll in all  would say getting uxury is easier in anada ustralia than in ndia ut getting amily and friends is easier in ndia nd as someone already mentioned if you have ids then the equation is entirely different  migrated to anada in 2017  its been a great experience for me so far  but it boils down to effort  luck and circumstances y standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers  a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in ndia aving said that  though  ve never been a particularly money obsessed person ive me a cot  3 square meals and a roof over my head and m good  but  do appreciate that the quality of stuff  get here is substantially better for the amount  pay for it compared to ndia rofessional growth  d argue its the opposite due to my specific circumstances mployers let you ork from ome  some others  like mine  have an education allowance to allow you to upskill on the companys dime   get plenty of days off  5 day work week  statutory holidays means no work  its actually straight up criminal and  get hristmas week  till ew ears off  obody questions interrogates you if you want to take a few days off  actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said d be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job  love my coworkers and we get along very well acism  ant speak for ustralia but in anada  its mostly been lowkey and barely noticeable if not nonexistent  largely owing to the significant number of ndians already in anada   outside of some clearly mentally ill people  the city of oronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people  especially now that its summer and theyre all around the city  ve already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what  am  hird ulture id  so not really fully ndian and not really super westernized  either  so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion appy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in anada   also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land t could be ou need to identify what pay in anada ustralia is equivalent to the 16 lpm  hen identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better or factors such as free subsidized medical  education and to some extent a higher standard of living  to each his own  t is definitely worth doing it appy to answer in private too specially about ustralia r even ew ealand o this might be a one off case but even younger ndian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shockg 1  y friend and his two kids stayed in oston o ndians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them  also  known as child abuse   o his kids friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them is kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit  have ever laid my eyes upon e and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them he kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them o the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids hey eventually moved back to ndiag 2 if you are a conservative ndian  be prepared for your kids teenage years hey will date other people  probably indulge in casual sex  have secret alcohol parties ress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb  nstagram etc his is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west  have a modern friend who is well travelled  well read  rich and comfortable but just cant sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing hey can compromise on many things but kids possible promiscuity is something they cant adjust to his was few observations from a a decade ago or so epends on your line of work too   guess  16  friend of mine moved to anada for   he was in  here before that  and struggled to find a job in business management o switched to  after doing his  since he saw better job prospects here ithin anada there are a lot of variations as well ancouver and oronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts algary  dmonton  ontreal  innipeg and alifax are far more affordable alifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable anada isnt as high paying as the  ut its offset by free healthcare  education  the environment there ts a massive pain to adjust to any new country ven if you find a job that pays 100k  a year  the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same ut  depending on where in anada you are for example   youll find a robust ndian community anadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario ustralia is just way too racist for my personal taste heyve a very rigid set of thinking  have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place  there is a rump like  in ustralia now bsolutely  was a

75, skndia  ow would you like an appbased  healthy tiffin service https  wwwredditcom r india comments b2vyxr askindia how would you like an appbased healthy   at fit is already doing it tealing your idea ya later  think it would be a good idea here used to be a few services like this in angalore  redcooker or something along those lines  hy not go for a model like lue pron in the   wherein the user subscribes for pre portioned ingredients with recipes in a way thats user friendly for beginners to make  love to cook and experiment  but the daily grind ensures that 90 of the time  end up eating out or ordering takeaways  ounds like a good idea to me d definitely use it and would be willing to pay a little extra  just dont make a fool of customers with exorbitant airport like prices for tiny portions bsolute hygiene is my number 1 priority love  cap and sterilize the shit out of everything possible nd dont just say itive us proof et external agenices to audit the hygiene if such agencies exist  and also post thorough ygiene standards and rules so that we can hold you accountable ut uo youtube videos of kitchen tours k now lets come to nutriton bviously do your research and make everything healthy but also add an rganic tier he rganic variety should have the main things like chcken and milk sourced orgamically  ie  without pesticides or hormones etc nd lastly money ou guys need to make the least possible profit that fits your model or else this system fails nd lso reach out to cities where similar services dont exist yet cover all the metros to begin with  hats about it   onestly  guess you guys are already done with all the planning and investing phase and are going to launch soon so whats done is done  but still one can hope  can he not one  there is an app on oogle play store called ofi which does the same estricted to hennai though ike inmen  here is your would be startup based  ow is this different from eat fit or half a dozen health food restaurants listed on swiggy right now was witness to the great food tech boom of 2014  couple of which promised calorie counted  nutrition counted  healthy meals one of them survived hy not become an aggregator for homechefs here are quite a few home run catering services and moms who cook everyday for their family  if they have an extra meal which might be wasted or forcefully eaten  you can use it and just need to take care of packaging and delivery omemade meal averages out to s 30 per meal  3 rotis  daal and one veg   you can buy it for 50 and then sell it with packaging and delivery for a nominal profit and at the same time get moms in to the gig economy  ll the best   heck out  ood darzee  https  wwwfooddarzeecom   if you havent already hey pretty much do the same  suggestion ive detailed nutritional detail for each meal plan  to be viewed upon button click or something nd maintain the quality and taste of food while meeting the nutritional detail exactly  ox8 also did this  cooking food and delivering it  but  doubt they couldnt run this long lso  any type of delivery business is the worst ideadit  in umbai  some restaurant also does it on personal portal like hellogreenin atfitult is already there  am a budget user f i get healthy meals at 50  70  will be more than happy  urefit is very costly uppose each meal cost around 150 o for 25 days it comes around as 3750 hich is 25 of 15000 rupees 15000 rupees is standard salary of freshers   people who are in large numbers o curefir meals constitute 25 of salary  f you bring the cost to 1 3 rd  of 3750 ie 1250 will be glad to buy it definitely an untapped and good idea in india try to include more of local stuff unlike ichef also follow try following blue aprons business model as something on the side for cheaper prices i definitely see potential in mumbai  actually sounds like a good idea  efinitely sounds like a good idea for big cities ult fitness in bangalore already does it and it looks popular at least from zomato reviewsy only request would be eco friendly biodegradable packaging  if you are moving forward with the idea  another one  used one app  inen which does exactly this heck the food subscriptions here in   you may be inspired ubscriptions here send portioned out meal kits to make your own food  this works because you dont need to do any shopping or measure quantities heres a spice only subscription too ou mean  eatfit  https  eatfit  version 20  ym diet please  cant make chicken at home will eat outside if theres a tiffin app  he market is already saturated with similar services ince you are entering a crowded space  your customer acquisition costs for the first 2 years are going to be very highnspite of all the odds   the ndian consumer is moving towards healthy and organic food and there is still a huge market for it  if your able to offer something unique to consumers  you will succeed  personally would love a good app based tiffin service   have tried some  but the food becomes too routine after some time and doesnt feel worth the exlenditure anymore o my suggestion would be to try and make the menu have some surprise elements  so that every meal feels different lso   dont know if its logistically possible  but customizable amount of spices would be a great feature for a tiffin service hat said  all the best  m going to ask you the same questions  anyone when they talk about their idea he product  what is it  use case  who would want it  he market    size  competition  dynamics to be aware of  roduct analysis   comparison against competition hat stage are you in o you need money re you raising ustomer conversion strategy  where do you find them  and how do you make them buy  from you  hy you hy are  the best person for this job  experience good team rich daddy who cant bring himself to pull the plug what  ave you thought differently about this idea differently what are you offering thats different from others in the same

a bit  being a lawyer oure being remarkably levelheaded about this  which  is a huge plus that being said   understand your motivation to gather evidence  but make sure you do nothing illegal ou dont want to have a criminal case against you  and  as others have said  our judicial system is quite biased towards women  competent lawyer could easily allege stalking  outraging the modesty of a woman  indecency  etc nother thing is to make sure you go to the right lawyer ou mentioned youre going to the best lawyer in the city ake sure he she also practices in the district courts  where your case

sure you are taking the right decision et off that cheating piece of shit erm  pretty sure its illegal to monitor her email phone i will not recconmend you to do any spying on her phone but but you can use some simple technique to unlock her phone when she is not there and also fb or whatsapp massage willnot b a better evidence as u need hard evidence a video or photograph maybe install a webcam  ook dude i dont have any idea about this stuff but most of the people here are saying to gather enough evidence so i will suggest try to hire a private investigator who will help you with that stuff  also contact your lawyer about this f you dont have any evidence  then play it cool r else  she will figure out something is up  and guess you know n which case  she might file fake domestic violence charges against you to make your future claims look unreliable lso   would recommend you delete this post too ust in case she or her lover frequents this sub firstly freeze your bank accounts and other valuables so that wife does not have accessthen collect as many evidences as possible video and audio recordings work bestafter all this confront your wife and ask your divorcetell her that you have strong evidences if she resists ey   firstly m really sorry to know youre in such a situation t sucks owever you seem to have a level headed plan for the future ont listen to folks who are

filing a case etc est of luck  ore power to you  hether you want a divorce or not is entirely your decision ont listen to any of the toxic advice on here regarding that he best thing you can do now is think of her purely as the mother of your children and not your wife ry and be as mature as you possibly can for the sake of your children sking for full custody of your children  hence depriving them of a mother  because she cheated on you is unfair on you  her and  importantly your children t will also make you look vengeful and petty ore than that it will really affect your relationship with your kids in the future er cheating on you is no indication of her being a bad mother astly  for gods sake   try to track her communication  stalk her or snoop around s you know its illegal and if the court she find out  it will make you look really  really bad ou say you are not planning to do that to gather evidence for the court hy else are you doing this then ow on earth will doing this help you deal with the situation ou say she is dramatic but if you do this then you are fighting fire with fire o to a good lawyer and listen to them eddit is not the place to get advice for this stuff his place is full of immature teens and young adults who have no idea what you are going through and theyve probably never been in a relationship before hey are  selfadmittedly  giving you advice based on movies ou dont need this right now o to a lawyer and stop listening to reddit m sorry for what you are going through  hope you are able to deal with this well and be there for your children his is going to be really difficult for them so try and make it as easy as possible for them ont make them choose between you and her  they need both parents ood luck    ucking hoes man nd the damage is almost unrepairable een so long    still cant trust anyone ood luck mate ow old are your kids ts very difficult for the father to get custody of his teenage children ou should take advice from the  only regarding snooping her s that even legal nd why dont you confront her  it will be messy but might really prevent some miscommunication on your part ou cant monitor her phone and social media  thats illegal  ont break the law as part of collecting evidence any sensible lawyer she hires will have that shit thrown out and hurt your case irreparably d say its lucky that she doesnt know you know  keep it that way and follow the advice of your lawyer ello   sorry to read about the pain you are experiencing  know that extra marital affairs have become extremely common in ndia and most

youre upset and you have every right to be  but youre asking for full custody because she cheated oure going to take your anger which you justifiably have towards your wife on your children by depriving them of their mother m not sure how the law works where you are but where  am  emails and all that begotten without consent of the other person do not count in a court of law ire a  nd also  do whats best for your kids he may be a shit wife but she has a right also to her children  his is not the right forum onsult  r relationships  r relationship advice  specifically mention that you are in ndia i  its upsetting to read this  but from my experience of being standing and seeings a frnds irreparable marriage i would like to suggest something is it the first instance this this is happening  mean had your alwaays marriage been in problems ow did this all start he the distance between 2 of you increasing after any particular event hat i want to say is the the cheating only reason ad she never loved you he cheating is more of a need for love or togetherness or just cheating lso one more thing has your daily life with her gone worse like daily fights or and things r u just act cool and she does too ust pretend we all are cool and lovely  may sound wrong but we all know when things start to go wrong  the distance between people starts increasing if you really love her and you can find a human reason for what she is doing can that can be repaired i would suggest you take a higher stand than her i know its hard ut at the end you would know u are better  u gave her chance maybe there might be some mistakes u must have made on the way  that she wanted to distance from you and find love somewhere else  ut you know we are humans  and we need love he only thing i would to suggest you is if feel this is not cause of the distance that had been growing since time   keep gathering your evidence and keep it safe look it at a perspective of why would she do that find a reason in those evidences and history u have together sometimes people drift away in search of love  donno who to blame in these cases but as a person with understanding the human nature can we give try to give human instinct some chance  think we can rom my experience i would suggest u gather evidences  with mere goal of knowing whats wrong  if this looks more like cheating than just a person trying to go away u will know if its  a sexual escapade or a find for love u will be able to see those in chats or anything while at it  i would suggest u try to talk to her not openly maybe ask her whats wrong why has your relationship detoriated over time if it has  maybe she wont open up it will take time make sure you u dont sound like u are accusing her of cheating oz  that thing is going to make her feel guilty as hell and she wont let u know anything furtherf your goal is to just leave her then dont think about what i have said above but is you plan it know things and what has gone wrong  coz all this pain you and u cant bliv this has happened u can try to talk and know whats wrong no need to present evidences maybe she comes back if she starts to realise the distance has increased and she has done a grave mistake ll d best  e humans are the capable of mistake as well as forgiveness dont forget this dont need to continue u may have already tried all those things i have said above maybe u are at the brink on no way out so i can understand u need to have ur freedom too ur peace of mind too have a great day   deleted   can give you the exact value of  ont monitor her personal stuff t doesnt look good on your partuestions you need answer to yourself  how is she as a mother ould the kids be okay with you getting sole custody t seems like you have not confronted with her yet ay be you have not been available much to her he is human after all his is perfectly repairable  you need to be more understanding and accepting ont take this step gnore other guys advising about divorce  collecting proof etc t depends 1 ry to hint to her and warn ee if it can improve the situation2 f you really love her or she loves you  there is still hope3 f you believe in virginity and all those stuff4 y all means try to fix it and live with her lse life of kids will be a mess f mother has affair that can hurt kids badly  if father has affair  not that much hink well and decide ll the best  an ry to amend this relationship ou are breaking your homeou are looking into years of litigation  including dowry  maintainance  child custody  and possibly defamation rape more if your wife is clever our whole life will become a mess hildren dividedo yourself a favor ont get involved in this mess  am facing such mess and its not worth itive her one last warning nd discuss the

85, skndia  hat are your unpopular generalizations about society https  wwwredditcom r india comments aftiwi askindia what are your unpopular generalizations   ublic chutiya hai  ndian people dont really care much for their liveswell most of em the way roads are crossed  the way trains are clinged on  the way cars are driven  the way electricity lines boards are set up  the way noone cares about allowing access to handicaps  the way people wanna go before the ambulance i can go on and on and onits weird that people show fright when they watch horror movies or when some mob gathers to beat them but the way they go about living each day of their lives doesnt show they care much about taking care of themselves  ive seen this hold especially true in macho men and less in women   removed  ctivists only care for issues while the issues themselves are unpopular or not talked about  ecause they get off on the feeling of being the only ones fighting for ithey throw protests with 12 people at cafes nobody visits and then complain that society doesnt take the issue seriouslyhe moment their issues get momentum from the masses  they find some reason to criticize the movement and stay out of them hen someone popular takes up an issue  like an actor who has 10000x more reach than any activist  or when it becomes a hashtag with millions of people taking part  they wont try use this momentum to strengthen the movement heyll just belittle it and write long think pieces about how the public personality is missing the point or how everyone else is wrong and how they and they alone understand the true nuance of the situationhen the irbhaya movement saw massive crowds form across the country   noticed so many feminist activists stay out of it because it was a middleclass protest and because where were you when previous rapes had happened hey criticized the movement instead of adding to itve noticed this happen so many times on so many different issues that ve given up thinking its limited to just one branch of social activism y generalization is that activists hate when the people actually take up their issue  because they no longer feel like its their issue

already happeningoung educated ndians are facing a drastic mental pressure as soon as theyre done with their studiesnd  ndian society is very structured and surprisingly united in holding on to its dogmas hile young people are still figuring out whats on their mind  theyre buried under the societal shit of finding a suitable job  marriage  giving their parents grandkids to play with  buying a vehicle  buying a house  etc nd before theyd realize whats on their mind  most of them would be no longer youngome young people cannot take it  they break away and become recluse  few others  desperate to prove themselves to the society  follow mobs  become vandals and cause chaos ut most just suck it up hey learn to live with it hey grow up to either quell the dogmas or propagate them further  only hope the former triumphsm sorry if that sounded depressing d be happy if someone could change my mind  have 0 friends for 3 years  no collage  coaching or job 0 interaction with anyone except my family  go out once a week amn eems like have ikikomori for 3 years ve seen and studied cases where people get into that phase many a times because of medical reasons  like disorders and infectious disease  ut its sad how people become socially withdrawn because of external reasons like a bad breakup  loss of loved one and circumstances of situation ll it needs is a few words from those who care and give support throughout olitude is a state of isolation that is temporary ike suddenly trying to stay home for a whole week binge watching series and not facing the sun ome people end up there because of many reasons  and theyve been through a lot of shit ome fall in never to get up and feeling comfortable in a hole because its far better than the shitshow happening outside it ur education is taking pride in making products  like engineers with  and  in foreign niversities   judging on how much you earn and how rick you look othing else hey have a very stupid yardstick just for judging elp another guy uck it or dumb people who blame the internet for this  this is the  safe space for many people nfortunately  those boxed up isolation chambers contains many hidden gems here are thousands of mazing s  reat artists  kickass gamers who feel its better to be anonymous  chatting with random persons across the globe rather than their own family  because the family is

would find it fun to talk to you and support you  can be one if you wouldnt mind y inbox is always open tay safe#x200   big difference between apan and ndia is that apan is a 1st world country and most people can afford to keep their kids at home doing nothing without a significant change in their lifestylen ndia  most people can not afford to support an adult without any benefits and parental push or hunger would force a person to work  or become a destitute owever  in middle and upper middleclass households   wont be surprised with a rise of ikkikomori lifestyle  deleted   removed  es  shitty private college engineering oly hit am one of them t has made a landfall on our large shitholes  metros  where traffic is where we see outside world  filled with strangers  and mobile is where we socialize his daily routine coupled with work studies family pressure can make even a sane logical thinking person who sees no meaningful outcome with social interactions other than for greed and power go into social isolation ndia with its growing middle class will be a ikikomori warehouse in the near future  h god ve been wanting to make a post like this for a long time s a 22yearold   was probably part of the last generation  in ndia at least  of kids who spent most of their childhood outside playing socializing than on digital screens agree with your post  we absolutely have an invisible problem lurking just below the surface of our false outer facade of the demographic dividend potential e have an insane number of young people  with a super narrow set of opportunities  whore growing up in a culture that absolutely sucks at socializing  dating  and having conversations and  connection with even the fucking neighbors  https  wwwwashingtonpostcom world asia pacific indiansingatedcommunitiesmeettheirneighborsonline 2012 06 12 gvjf storyhtml ith the spread of the internet  not blaming it  it just catalyzes the worst aspects of the problem    only see this problem getting worse ost kids are growing up alone with barely any social skills  and without proper intervention  theyll go on to have terrible lives as adults  and as you noted  die a lonely death dd me ts been two years  ost married women in lower middle class   deleted   live in apan now and back in 20122013  spent a good six months confined to my room at my parents house in ndia  wasnt unemployed though   worked remotely   simply tired of people and the mundane routine that was my life  know a few of my friends  in ndia  who quit their high paying jobs and decided to backpack across the country and live as a free spirit  they dont use cellphones  e all have our own coping mechanism to deal with life as we know it  mine was gaming and traveling around the world   is just one such way ts not because of over work it could be anything that causes a person to believe life inside four walls is a better life ome ikikomori do work remotely here are several manga artists  singers  and even developers  know who are ikikomori but with a profession  heyll refuse to make public appearances or do video calls but happily work and text hink of ikikomori as someone on a house arrest but voluntarily he house for them is a safe zone  psychologically speaking  where no harm would come to them both physically and mentally ou should watch https  youtube w1853 which is a more accurate description of what it is than return to   also recommend these anime o ame o ife  romanga sensei and reife if you want to explore ikikomori via anime subculture eel free to ask me anything you wish to know  ne category everyone of you missed  unmarried  unemployed women who have aged beyond what is commonly considered marrying age nother category is divorced women hese two have existed in ndian culture since time immemorial  know a few people in these categories he fear of a girl entering this category is the main reason ndian relatives parents pressurize girls to get married as soon as possible eah  was one in my early to mid 20s  only got out because of support of my parents hough even now  feel detached from the narrow focus of the society around me  and often times struggle with motivation he only thing thats constant for me is my love of my chosen field  think its happening ot the exact phenomenon but we do have an ndian version of it  employees in metro cities and  aspirants are somewhat the same t happens very slowly  most them dont even realize this  only after some midlife crisis hits them ut as always  they are not to be blamed hey are the result of a broken system and societal pressures he day is not far away  when we will see some of them call it quits and move to their native place again or look for a different career option espite the so called inclusive society  high levels of social isolation is very common in urban areasice post btw or those of us reading from outside ndia  could you please explain what  is side from that  think youve made a very well  articulated argument and although  only have a basic understanding of ndian social dynamics   have spent a good amount of time in apan and  can potentially see some similarities in the results although  believe the reasons are quite different n ndia  the assurance of family support might be the cause despite people having genuine ambition  such as the the friend youve cited   whereas in apan there seems to be a growing lack of ambition from the getgo oung people are losing the desire to compete in society  possible for fear of failure here is also a term for this in apanese which translates along the lines of planteating boy and refers those young men who would rather stay home than take any risks at all  while being primarily used in the context of dating   es ostly because of 2 reasons  the job market is fucked o parents pressure kids into doing things they have no interest in and in the end it all goes wrongow why is the job market fucked retty sure there are jobs orrect he problem is not that there are no jobs ets explain with example kid is provided with everything from phone to house to car because his or her parents worked hard and reached the level they are at ow  the market is so screwed  a person on employment cannot build a decent house in a good area all his her life ids are under pressure to achieve more than their parents because they assume my parents earned this  and its not enough for me  gotta earn more o they are satisfied with jobs that pay less but what parents dont usually tell their kids is that they also started with low paying jobs y father started with 1200 rupees a month and earns 2 lakh a month now hough it took all life ids expect they will start at 10 or 20k and then within 3 months it should double dreams nd even if their parents tell them  they discard it by saying tab to sab kuch sata tha rue it was cheap but their pay was low too ts the same o simply  these kids have had it all and dont think its necessary to earn because they wont enough for it to mean anything  so why not live on your parents money nd that is how they become shutin that combined fear of judgement from society ope  could explain properly  ocial media also has its share in contributing to the problem t took me some time understanding how society and family influences your desires and what you want to pursue in life nly a minority would achieve that kind of success early in life which would require talent  hardwork  motivation  ability to focus for long amounts of time and a bit of luck hen you disentangle from all those expectations  you feel light  you finally get to know yourself and what you want to pursue in life ou get to see your flaws in a nonjudgemental way and start working on them at your own pace omens high dating standards in apan also contributed to the problem ost women there would prefer to stay single than to date  marry a average looking  earning guy his resulted in men dropping from society  can see this happening in our country in the very near future o it will never happen in india in the same manner it happened in japan or not happened all togetherur society is not made in a way to allow space or too much personal  freedom hat they can be separated from the society   never thought i would see a thread about being a ikikomori in r india but i would like to share my experience  so after i had given my  exam there was a long break in the duration before i appeared for  o as usual during this time the pressure from my family to study to get a good collage was highest and also as i generally do not like to talk to people i got my full freedom to become a  like i didnt leave the floor i was on for 2 months and the experience was not very pleasant but liberating as  didnt have to face my family or so called friendsthe duration of this was about 24 months but then collage happened and now i am rehabilitating into the society i still hate people and do not talk much but at least i am not a shut in now  ubground  stay indoors and enjoy my time alone  ep  do think ikikomori is a thing in our country ve been unemployed for a while now and the materialization of my ambitions hasnt happened yet  m studying hard and have confidence in myself but still  try to avoid socializing as much as possible  it just doesnt feel worth it xercising  junk food  netflix and studies is all  do and yet  do not feel as depressed as  should because even without achieving anything that matters in the real world   have somehow accepted the fact that one day  will make something of myself ut  do fear the whatif scenarios where  couldnt do what  set out to do he fear of failures is strong and we try to keep that fear locked in a box but the society keeps reminding you of that fear  ow ear my story  am a 25 year old  now  lets start when i was 18 year old   was  a   indass type uy but surrounded by wrong group of friends which they cheated on me thinking i am a hutiya  riends used to take advantage of me so  liked a irl but couldnt approach her and tell  that  like her but i didnt had that strength wasted 5 years of my life in that phase she went to erala for her medical career  and i left  career course in mid way so couldnt complete it  was depressed and got lazy spending most of the time on the internet and playing video games some times i had suicidal  thoughts but then i overcame it thinking its all a temporary feeling   wanted to be a software developer after bcom completion in 2015 but i didnt had that motivational strength to do it and then i joined a company in 2016 and left it after 5 months due to pressure from seniors and for a period of 1 year i was mentally disturbed then in 2017 i joined a call center bpo worked for 5 months due to low salary and drug addicts and wrong crowd i left the company on lunch break and for a period of 6 months i wasted  wandering what to do i wanted to go into software development but some astrologer told me that i will not have a career on technical field so didnt had that much motivation to do later i went to  erala for a mid vacation and then  got a call from ccenture stating they wanna  hire me so i went for the interview in umbai for  process nsurance again not part of my interest and lot of pressure spent 8 months of working and later  eft it  then i watched a ocumentry on outube of ikkikomori people then i got to know thats what i am going through y career is totally fucked and crumbled now  i am fighting against my lethargy and trying all the best i can to get into oftware development field n insightful post after a long time on r ndia hanks for sharing  deleted  oo poor for that shit ost men in ndia cant afford to sit only at home hey need to get out and work to get food many millions will  statistically  die aloneost people die alone  dont know if it counts as half ikikomori  but when m in engineering all  did is go to college and come to home ometimes  even didnt go to college for few weeks and stayed at home m doing a job now ut its same  office  home  zero interaction  want to get rid of this habit but well still cant   came across this a while ago and quickly realized it is not just a apanese phenomenon because  was able to relate to it so much  quit three well paying jobs in past two years to stay at home and try to earn an income on my own  but havent succeeded so far ave up soon and got a job the first two times  but now its been six months since ve been at home after quitting my last job f only  can make a living by staying at home  ll be a ikikomori for life  ro dk what to do  ve been a recluse myself for over 5 years  ah  akikomori completely different to whats happening in ndia ndian job aspirants experience social isolation but they still have minimal interaction and goals  but its nothing like being a  ikikomori is way too severe  like 5 years at average inimum 2 years to even consider yourself to be one lso  theres eetbux and money from their parents even at the age of 2530  they also dont have any goals other than self pleasure  ndian parents rarely raise a 30 year old child ikikomori rarely get get out to the point that goraphobia ou cant compare ikikomori to ndian isolation ont think ndian parents will let it get that bad ake ndian social isolation and multiply it by 8000 times  then you get a hikikomori erhaps it had to do with the current job scenario in our country or may be not but  think its a reflection of the educational system that focused too much on irrelevant things like  or leaving no other choice for students than tech and such ad thing still being that parents are unable to accept the fact that engineering and related streams are saturated and its not a decision to be made by parents but rather its the teenager who should be capable enough to take a decision on their ownnd the work culture in ndia is starting to improve  at least in the  world  with the startups popping up but its gonna take a long time for those stubborn corporations to adapt to a better work environment  ts very difficult to be a hikikomori in ndia because there are so many people and everybody wants to have something to do with you ontrary to what you are saying  its almost impossible to be forgotten because somebody will always ask about you or if they havent seen you for a long time will just ask straight where youve been and what youre doing ocial isolation is probably the most difficult thing to achieve here eing socially isolated assumes an individualist society which we havent been able to build yet or  me  am kind of a social recluse ut  not as bad as a ikikomori as  have a job and  still go out to tea with my gang  am trying to improve ell done  on putting forward a topic which is prevalent but isnt talked about much ts just like several other problems which arent considered as real problems in ndia  feel itll be a long time before ndians try solving it hey first need to recognize it as a problem  ontrary to popular belief here   think that the ndian culture that is rooted into me wont permit me to become a complete shut in not matter how low  fall here is the added fear that parents would stop supporting altogether  not to mention the society pressure of doing something productive do however agree that male loneliness is very much on the rise  but dont think that it will progress to the point where a considerable amount of people would become hikkis ancy way of saying that  am have depression and anxiety  re  dattebayo e get it  you saw a new anime ntisocial behaviour agoraphobia depression anxiety have been pretty common phenomena everywhere  not confined to apan  they just gave it a different name ur suicide rates are quite telling,1

dont think thats what haroor is really talking about ore from the perspective of itler is taught to be an evil guy now n germany as well et  ritain has mostly whitewashed the horrors theyve committed in what they teach to their own kids ontinuing the same stuff    hes raising awareness about the atrocities that theyve committed  and thats something  can get behind  think haroors main goal is to educate the modern estern masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism  that they conveniently leave out in their history text books his was an interesting counter narrative as well as essentially wrote the same thing in ndia nbound ut  dont think it really contradicts haroors claims  veryone of as arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ndia back but he lets the rits go cott freees  there were individual entrepreneurial success stories  too few benefited  es  the uropean institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes  the caste system was responsible ut without a ndian structural head who couldve changed things or we couldve had an enlightment  a historical whatif   the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth hat carries a lot of culpability he drain theory is definitely true he  was paying 400 000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the gifts to arliament all sourced from ndia hey took advantage of urgazebs tax exemption he arathas  awab of wadh and yderabads izam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the rench and  well before 1857 safuddaula paid 76 million rupees annually just to be recognised awab in 1797 he point is  the money couldve been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldnt be as poor as we are now book came out last year called elling mpire ndia in the aking of ritain and merica  16001830 which demonstrates the centrality of ndiaboth as an idea and a placeto the making of a global ritish imperial system ssentially  the new world was discovered because olumbus was searching for riches in ndia e makes the argument that in the runup to the merican evolution  the ast ndia ompany played a visible and disturbing role n his view  mericans awareness of the ompanys conquests in ndia  and the establishment of an authoritarian government there  evoked the fear of a shared place for ndians and mericans in a corrupt and despotic empire  ollowing the evolution  mericas connection with ndia paradoxically expanded  as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of ndian consumer fashions uch of it  however  arose fortuitously out of the extended ritish wars with rance from 1794 onward  as a neutral power  the nited tates was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others y 1806  ndia had contributed 4 percent of  imports  and mericans commanded much of the ontinental uropean market for ndian goods  t gave ndia almost a hundered years of peace m done  wouldnt call 100+ of looting and injustice peaceful ave read the whole thinghe ehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the ritish periodaking information from the article itself   think we can still blame the ritish for not letting ndia join the industrial revolutionhis they did by creatingow literacy education  n a modern economy  this alone will mean that youll fail to compete nstable political environment  low confidence  n an uncertain future  why will anyone invest time and capital  here is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason ndians didnt moved toward industrialization nd he also mentioned that ndians had no money to buy anything at that time hen how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed snt these things require time especially a skills gained after education  think once a generation of ndian educated enough in 1980s they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills nd of course we cant deny the poor government policies but  feel completely blaming them isnt right  a thing s there something wrong  have understood from this article aved for later oo long to read right now ets just sum it up he ritish did many good things and bad thingsersonally m glad for stuff like outlawing ati and reforming personal laws which m sure most of our post independence governments wouldnt have the guts to touch as ndia ever a rich nation in the first place eople use the 27 of world  stat to justify the label but we had 27 of the world population also at that time oth hashi haroor and urcharan as are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation  lightly off topic  but  believe much of haroors ritish bashing is just shrewd political posturing hen he first ran for parliament in 2009  the air community voted for him en masse because he is one of us he educated liberal class voted for him because he had the it factor  undersecretary general of the   erudite  sophisticated etc e won handily  with a huge margin n 2014  a lot of the older airs voted  because they stand for indu values  evidence for this is anectodal  everyone in my  +wifes  family voted haroor in 2009  most of our parents generation voted  in 2014  haroor still had the youth liberal vote and won  but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009  huge slide n 2019  he faces the prospect of running against uresh opi  popular actor  current      and stands a real risk of losing  consider his antirit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowdt is really simplistic to claim ritain looted us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of ndias wealth was concentrated in the hands of amindars  awabs and ajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the ndian subcontinent before the ritish brought it all together ell haroor is not completely wrong either ndia was rich  maybe not as rich as all those hatspp forwards mention like 27 of world  and other crap  also believe that haroors fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches  think hes going to use this wave of false patriotism thats been around which makes people

147,hy do we see so little  rather negligible representation of   s in mainstream politics even though they are significant in number https  wwwredditcom r india comments bhhltn why do we see so little rather negligible   here are currently 84 seats for scheduled tribes and 47 seats for scheduled castes  which amounts to a total of 131 seats  a significant number to make their voices heard and be a part of mainstream politicshose reserved seats change location  afaik  and arent concentrated in a region but spread over the country ith reserved seats  when a person from reserved seat would have won  s he wouldnt have faced the strongest candidate from that area  and hence would likely not gain power later when it isnt reserved his means which ever   s win they likely arent first choice of the people and unlikely to repeat which means they lack power which you expect from 131 seats ore over s from these seats are from different parties  leading to them having different agendas ayawati for example is from  nd   is a party that campaigns on    agenda  but mostly serves its leaders cheduled tribes are almost always from states with marginal political impact n case of  s they do come from large states ut again the largest of these block come from  nd you would notice the most visible  s come from  as well lso the mainstream parties either intentionally or unintentionally sideline the   s ase in point ual ram e was the only  from  from disha ow mriti rani harmendra radhan  were inducted into cabinet in high visibility ministries where as ual ram got relatively obscure inistry   affairs  ongress was even worse n 2009 ongress won 6 seats from disha in 2009 3 f those were from   seats one were in the council of ministers his was answered by mbedkar himselfhere is joint electorate with reservation owever the population of   and   is too low to ensure majorityo the majority community would field a candidate who belongs to   and    but would actually represent the interests of the majority communityrgo  not benefit the   and  rancesca  ensenius  2017  ocial ustice through nclusion confirms this1ondition of  in reserved constituency is not better than non reserved constituency2overall development of reserved constituency is not worse off then non reserved constituency3has transferred the power to leaders of  and   communityhus mbedkar was right in asking for separate electorates ts because these leaders are fielded primarily by political parties because there is constitutional requirement to field such candidates ake that away  and  can promise you that representation would go down significantly ust look at muslim representation in legislatures ven parties like  dont field  candidates from unreserved seats because they know that they will not get votesost mainstream political parties are also not interested in development of alit political leadership ll they want is ongress alit leader or  alit leader or  insert your party  alit leader f these leaders move away from the party line on alit issues then they will face the musicnother issue is that the mainstream media is dominated by upper classes and they will invite alit figures only to speak on alit issues or everything else  the upper classes will be the voice ook at  debates in   you will find that all spokesmen and panelists tend to be disproportionately rahmins or hakurs as if other communities simply dont have anyone to speak on topics of national and local importance ts true that some of these are down to structural makeup of society but there is no serious attempt either to change it t is because of the faulty design of   elections in our country hich mbedkar realized soon after independence n the system of reserved seats and not separate electorates et us consider a example here is a staunch dalit party who actively rails against the sawarnas and genuinely wish to work for dalits heir candidate for the reserved seat is r alit e is extremely popular among the dalits of that area hen there is a centrist or right wing party who dont have much fucks to give about dalits hey find a dalit ready to sell his soul for getting elected or for money so they get r old to stand on the reserved seat r old is unpopular among dalits of the area he seat has 30 dalit population hen elections comes  all those 30 vote for r alit ut the rest who are not very happy about this dalit party will vote for r old e will win by a great margin nd hence will come in arliament a dalit who is not going to speak a word about dalit issues mbedkar rand leader mbedkar stood for two  elections and lost both n the second one  he came third  t is only then that he realized that reserved seats are meaningless his is why mbedkar wanted separate electorate for   hats why poona act which he agreed to when andhi went on hunger strike is considered worse thing for dalits ead ashi ams chamach yug of its translation in your language to understand it more  deleted  nke pas govt

all  care about m from okayish caste  not too high  not too low ny caste generally means that they are okay with people of higher caste contacting them  o open minded is my caste plus caste considered above mine atrimonial sites are hilarious and sad just a thought  you are still 27 why hurry  here was a gilded comment by a black guy a few days ago that said that he really appreciated when the bullets dogdged him for a change  his is the same  nfortunately ndian matrimonial sites is just online aunty network without the aunties here will be the same  except its online ake some time out and start dating n the grand scheme of things  finding the right person is as important as   ny caste means any equal or higher casteducated modern broadminded ndian  hypocrites   you dodged a bullet with every one of thosearry a girl who  as they say  loves you at your worst ou are lucky you got matches y friend  bengali upper caste  from  didnt get any matches when he didnt mention caste in his matrimonial profile 5 years ago his is what modern day untouchability looks like    passout working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30 sincere  hardworking  simple dudeot 994 ile in   in 600s general in elugu stops reading  does not teach you that ndians are hypocrites of the first order  guy here  top educational institution and worked for top companies but not an   guyhen  got married  the first line of my profile was  am an   dont believe in eservation that benefits only the creamy layer est of the stuff   was very transparent about what  was looking for  a nononsense girl who is nonhypocrite  non pretentious humanist aste religion no barot fair number of interests from inside and outside my caste t was hard to see people with matching academic background from an  caste he non interests  received were mostly from other religionsarried to a nononsense unpretentious smart girl  her parents are from a brahman + other religion mix  couple of my close friends who married within their caste have said they wished their married life was as stable as mine  after interacting with my wife and me for a whileang on dude uck this shit m so tired of people acting all modern on the outside and being a casteist  hater on the inside his is just ridiculous ude hugs man  mean what can  say  just know that if someone asks you your caste theyre not worth your time   removed

shitty lso given the chance they can act even worse than men and they doesson no 2    aste never goes awayomen at the time of arranged marriage will prefer someone from their caste only no matter how open minded iberal or progressive they claim to behe reason for this ll those lables are to fit in socially and nothing elseesson no 3 veryones hypocritical ome will admit maximum wont hat doesnt change the fact  haadi ka laddu  ouch some people just suck    his is just sads much as  hate to say this  you should mention your caste on matrimony sites cos ppl do judge you based on caste and this unfortunately is the reality of ndia etter to keep the hypocrites at bay y parents had an intercaste marriage hat being said  it is a fact there are differences in upbringing  type of food  type of interests etc  and general attitude mentality of people   pet peeves  biases  dinner convos etc  of families belonging to different castes his isnt that big a deal if the couple plans to stay away from parents and love each other enough to get over the differences in mentality ut these differences cause a lot of issues when the couple decides to stay with either set of parents specially for the wife  know my mom suffered a bit in her early days since she is from a lower caste compared to my dad  similar thing happened with one of my aunts y dad stood by my mom and both of them were working and earning so things worked out eventually  my aunt ended up divorcing my unclen upper caste friend of mine married an  guy and her parents all but abandoned her  her husbands parents were somewhat accepting but issues did creep in over the years and now the couple are staying in a different cityy advice would be to find a girl who is willing to relocate and not overly attached to parents family or someone who has stayed abroad or has had a parent who has worked stayed abroad n those scenarios the caste issue will likely get diluted hoa  from inder directly to a matrimony website atrimonials suck very move is carefully considered joint action of atleast 3 people ts almost a business transaction o out  date  dance  flirt oull have fun and find someone who likes you for who you are  hat are you so busy doing that you dont have time to do that riorities  man ou are being honest in ndia  mate ont work unless she is 1 in a million  who literally doesnt care ide solo instead  i dont know if its true for most grills   but ll of the grills i know never married below their so called caste strata  but i know many guys who have relationships marriages without a fuss about this ll the best   you will find a wonderful bride ill then collect stories to publish a nice entertaining book it shouldnt be  but the others who f up by rejecting you based solely on caste ood for you  suggest leave this  madness and look for someone who actually likes you  o even a guy earning 30 lpa with  tag cant get over his caste when it comes to marriage hy are you not marrying within your community though   amn hat is really sad to read his must be really hurting for you am  too and nowhere near s financial and education status  guess   should start worry about marriage now   dont get the fuss around castes  dont know the caste of my ex   dont know the castes of my best friends  and  couldnt even be bothered to ask ts an irrelevant label given to people that people dont even get to choose elugu people are casteist   no  even here on randia caste feelings about marraige are pretty strong  people got triggered when sometime back i had suggested  after ambedkar  that people should marry outside their caste for eradicating caste system but seems that caste runs too deeply in the indian psyche ow i never knew caste is such a huge issue even in urban  areas  know for a fact that m   because 10th board forms ever knew what my caste is   but  never knew what my exact caste is  since we never used the reservation his discrimination is just saddening hank od m gay ot 994 ile in   also had got  in 600s general in o to urope et cool job et white girl hey dont know what  is why not post this on  r tifu thread i mean a lot of foreigners comming here to experience religion should know what they are buying into hat youre facing is did not read the instructions carefully ndian people dont read instructions on a hazardous item also et alone a marriage profilend like others have said   though you are wasting time   you are saving yourself from hypocrites his is sick  hope you find someone good yourself than through this arranged marriage business ood luck uch is reality ut keep an open mind and dont give up and weeding out the assholes is easier at this phase than at a later stage from a person in a similar situation as you ow  reat   experience  keep track of your experiences till you meet your wife and write a book ne day it can become a movie    his is the saddest thing  have read today hat the fuck people  aste is well alive even in urban ndia o matter what you get or achieve in your life  you will be always judged by your caste and color othing can change this mentality  think it happens for your good  can you imagine marry such narrowminded girl ou saved yourself bro keep trying on tinder ol see the down votes ood uck  but  think 27 is too early to get married aha this is so funny and so fucked up ncredible india his is so sad and disturbing if narrated events are rue  can understand if less educated villagers are caste conscious but highly educated professionals from etro have such mindset hocked and appalled erhaps   was mistaken that people get enlightened with education  deleted  caste system cant be broken by sustaining the system you have anyway rejected the reservations that you were provided  for which i respect you so  i dont see why you should still be hanging onto a demeaning label that somebody else gave your ancestors just make up a caste of your own and dont call yourself an  as far as i know  there is no law preventing you from creating a caste of your own y best friend a  is dating a rahmin  remember her mother found out and she told her he will never marry you  no higher casts would accept a  daughterinlaw er mother was right y friend is the daughter to two civil servants till this is the status quo  o no one is talking about 30  sorry for your condition  but being a dick that  m  would like sharing your  prep strategybligatory caste notification  ont know the caste but  m a fucking ribal  from ihar and do look like one  lso do invite me to your wedding if you dont mind a tribal in your wedding f you dont mind me asking kaun jaat ho  mean which castehy  am asking is because most northies including aharatrians wont know the elugu caste hierarchy unless you tell them o you can either say bluntly that you are  or you can tell them in a softer fashion that your caste is classified as  but it isnt comparable to northie hierarchy and also highlight your own achievements  mean soften the blowow  am going to  be criticised for what  said above as its playing the caste game and not taking the high road owever caste is a reality lso you have chosen arranged marriage route so you cant escape it lso your own post starts with claming you arent stereotyptocal  and you want to play up that card  oceital attitudes that makes one cringe acism  kincolor   casteism  or communalism  religion   these attitudes are programmed into us by an earlier generation   consciously or unconsciously ts our choice if we want to work at eliminating them from our psyche  these are like layers of an onion  impossible to cast off in one go  eing in contact with diverse people can of course speed up the unlearning oure fucking better off bro oure killing it professionally  and you can only go up from here  and youre obviously intelligent and well educated m not saying this to lift your spirits or whatever  you dont need that shit hat m saying is  if these people want to cling to archaic bullshit  let them hey may think youre beneath them but theyre wrong ou outclass them by far ou do you bruh  will die alone someday because  am of lower caste too minus the  pass out and fat paycheck stuff once passed out in front of a college so  guess that counts  ude  what do you expect in ndia ts uniformly hypocritical ive and learn   guess becuase there is a caste system   theres so much of reservation ow   why do you want to curb down the 49 that the general category has  m against the part where they allow them to take a general seat   know reservation cant be eliminated fully   atleast not in the near future  atrimonial sites are cancer void them at all costs ts better to get fixed by relatives aybe  dont really understand the issues of the   but why would you actively identify with something that has kept you and your people down for so long ou could have just said you were buddhist and have lived without a caste for the last 3 generationsou could have been happily married by now  but instead you would rather everyone know that youre part of a victimized subjugated interest group   figured  was ready to get marriedow ya figure that long time no sex  wanna know coz me 26  ou have worked hard for everything in life  work a little bit more for that   who accepts everything from you  eli snt that ewish ou got jebaited   ullet dodged like eo from the atrix   ongrats and good luck in your spousehunt s far as my experience goes  ven girls who are liberal    fuck around  mostly end up with with guys from their own caste only  rranged marriage is a fucked up process   f it is any consolation  m from an upper caste and  explicitly mentioned that  dont give a fuck about caste on my matrimonial profile only to face rejection from both upper and lower castes  was dumped by my gf of 2 years the moment her parents found out m a different caste and went on to emotionally blackmail her ind you  her caste is lower than mine he even had this super liberal  feminist personality facade about her magine my heartbreak when she jumped on the first opportunity to get hitched to an  job guy her parents introduced to her er parents main objection y caste  is one caste i like haha an i send my matrimonial page link for you to check et meknow  deleted  ou said you never used reservation eres a take on why people dont  when youre eligible in the general category too   you use  the general seat so that a seat in reservation remains empty   so someone else who got a lower rank can get that benefit hats how general seats get eaten up hats not something to be proud of   actually    lemme clarify that  never used it ot 994 ile in   also had got  in 600s general in or non reserved candidates  that just makes it worse putting salt on a wound  in 600s generalo you chose not to pick a better course at a better  using your quota f you didnt  youre stupid f you did  you did actually make use of the reservations benefitsheres no need to be this smug and patronizing arriages are social contracts  it involves adapting yourself to your spouses family culture in varying degrees f someones not fond of a certain group of people  ofcourse theyre not going to marry into that caste lso  different castes have different track records with status of women o if an upper caste woman refuses to marry a guy from a largely illiterate lower caste  it is very much understandable since chances are very high her freedom is going to be severely curtailed id you find any girls who were fine with your caste but felt family wont approve id you suggest any to try to discuss about your caste with their family  hich   hen did you pass out here do you work now dit why the hate ust want to make friends hy the fuck would someone  to marry below his or her social strata if given the choice,4

deleted  25 is still an early age ve known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite wellust make sure you use what you learn and build useful things ongrats on bouncing back lso  just remember that majority of ndian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry nless youre lucky  youll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years ust keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume ust my two cents ou are an inspiration bro ust one thing  dont wait for graduation to start earning money earn new things and start doing freelance work hen  was in college  the schedule seemed so hectic that  didnt find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports ut now in job   realize  had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar o competitive programming  contribute in open source  pick relevant projects  maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies ou have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates dont erspective changes with age and theres more clarity on what to choose based on how much value its gonna add se that advantage ou know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream o keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have hats such an inspiring journey  imo opinion failures are necessary for success  those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements etter late than never  was feeling quite anxious today about my career and  am just 21 ust graduated  dropped   picked up  ow ve been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened  was feeling defeated but  guess we only lose when we  stop trying ore power to you  to me and everyone who needs oull land

engineering and the college  grew up in odhpur ark  right next to adavpur niversity  even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment  think it was the chem engg dept but  could be wrong ou were probably in first year when  was in 1    did not face any of the adversities that you do  not even half of them s  read your post   realized how privileged a life  have had    one the less  dropped out of engineering  joined  rts s much as people hate on  arts  they are the most liberal people  have seen here was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to  arts and encourage them ind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now    nyways   arts turned it around for me  did decently there  went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a h which  am hoping to graduate next year  am 31 now and ironically  code for statistical analysis now  had dropped out of  engineering and the only difference is  like what  do now   he moment  read    hoped  would be the turning point for you  just as it was for me ut we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take     is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family     ont let people tell you what to do and how to do it  have had really stupid people both in  and mostly outside tell me that  would amount to nothing   because  dropped out and because of my age ro   started my h at 27  two students  met in my cohort 1 n merican frican woman aged 41 2  hite gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from merican rmy hese two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the h cohort h cohorts have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go  especially the econometrics paper hile the lady was not that good at maths  she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper hey outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects  ended up being really good friends with both of them n fact they are the closest friends  have on campus o no  age is honestly a number and nothing else  fight the good fight  f you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out  please reach out to me his was actually my last summer break here in the country and  will be in hiladelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything  can help you with  please reach out  am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country   nd again  fight the good fight   am sure you

well informed he people whom youre talking about are either experts in the subject or are avid readers ll you have to do to make your wish come true is to know about your own line of work  and read about the topics youre interested in or example  m a medical professional and  have responded to a couple of related posts  and since  like the posts related to politics too   read up on the topic before responding ts about how badly you want to know the topic  not about how much you already know irstly dont club everyone into one ultra smart person  highly upvoted post comment will be likely from an expert and naturally it will be rare econdly  if you are in awe of this level of expertise in general  then it is likely you havent got expertise of this level in any area ut you will  as you grow up nd also as you act on this awe from now itself  if you do that hirdly  when you start doing research or reading you will realise how much you are capable of and its almost guaranteed you underestimate that as of now astly  literally spout bs until someone calls me out on it and then  have to read about it to not make a fool of myself any further ead more on topics you like to master t takes years of passionately reading different voices on topic to form an informed opinion ven a less read person can sound well informed to someone who doesnt read at allhe point is  read ead about stuff you like ake time for it nstead of knowing every little news on nternet  focus on what you want to read e have an information mountain at our hands  but we have to pick what kind of info we want ont get overwhelmed by the size of the mountain  pick the stones that you need hats all you need   am the wisest man alive  for  know one thing  and that is that  know nothing lato ead both sides of the story from many sources and then form your own opinions veryone has an agenda elatable f you start reading a good ewspaper regularly then it will help you build opinions ou think people here or anywhere online actually know what theyre talking about h  you innocent babe ou are good man hese days it is so easy to have an opinion ou are way above the rest of the crowd tay there o sweetie  people are really lonely here obody here knows anything veryone is just faffing  or at least 90 of them one of us are walking encyclopaedias ach on of us just knows more than usual about 12 subjects ut everyone specialises in different subjects  so it feels like everyone knows everything ol half of the upvotes on political posts are from bots and astroturfing is the way of life for pro govt voices here   many posters do appear opinionated but often speak without coming across as wellinformed  and resort to ad hominem attacks and downvoting if asked for validation of their claims  o dont be shy and join the crowd eg to differ on the politics bit ndians and political information is not always well informed and involves a lot of cherry picked information oth left and right thinkers are guilty of this ou just gotta read more onus if you have personal experience or have been involved with the subject of the discussion ho says people here are well informed lmao  ruh we are all just shitpostingecond ts not rocket science like they want to think it is f you really want facts  then youll have to do your own first hand research ut do remember that facts are only bits and pieces that form a narrative and a narrative typically stands on both fact based and rumor propaganda based opinionshe opinions you typically hear from different people reflect their support for a narrative  its immaterial for them whether its based on facts or not n general  a narrative is supported by both facts and a bit of propaganda by media e live in an age of information warfare  so propaganda is bound to exist on both sides f one side ceases to create propaganda  the other side spreading it wins in the narrative battle nd losing this battle could mean losing both elections and public supportegarding which narrative to support for  read all the facts and opinions in support and against that narrative  and then ask your heart our own prejudices will also contribute in forming that narrative ome people have a proestablishment bias while others have an antiestablishment one  so theyll accept or reject narratives based on that bias ou can also be a centrist and support bits and pieces of both narratives  and your support for a narrative can even change as new information comes up ey thats  ou might be informed or be opinionated or passionate about other things o one gets to decide if someone who has opinions on politics is smarter than someone who has opinion on smartphones or video games o easy on life ts not a race to be smart ook at the strength of the sub 242k members bviously there will experts from different fields ot too late mate  you can learn too ead about logical reasoning and critical thinking  then apply it to world affairslso nobody is fully informed about anything e learn something new every day ell let me leave you with a tidbit here is a term in psychology called the unning ruger effect t states that people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is o while people may have an opinion on everything   unless they are an expert or at the very least have all the facts on a topic to make a proper assessment most people are usually speculating epends on what u are interested in s someone here already commented  its about how badly you want to learn the subject  am crazy about software engineering  building

pressure ust chill  he only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing    ocrates ou are not alone ere  if  this  https  wwwyoutubecom watchv92f mi  makes you feel better   n important thing to remember   think  is that not everybody who offers opinions on a subject is an expert  or even moderately knowledgeable ost people comment on things with only a rudimentary understanding of whats going on hence we have so much misinformation floating around ts easy to feel as though you dont know anything compared to the scholars on the internet who seem to have swallowed the encyclopedia brittanica whole  but remember thats usually not the case lso  like someone else said  knowing things is easy  as long as you make an active effort oin the world news sub ead a newspaper ducate yourself through the internet he good thing about this generation is that information is only a click away ut keep in mind  most accounts of events  whether current or historical  come heavily biased  so steer clear of forming any concrete views based on one piece of informationlso also  find what interests you  and the information will come to you naturally hen we first started dating   was supremely in awe of my ex because he knew so much about engineering and technology and politics  got caught up trying to overload myself on those topics before realizing that  knew just as much as he did  except about history and literature and architecture hile its great to have a basic understanding of everything  dont feel obligated to know everything about the topics you dont enjoy ame feeling just read books and newspaper  honestly reading newspaper is also quite fine youll soon see yourself having an opinion as well  have legitimately never seen someone here who was accurately informed

not hear about the movie event of the century ou should visit the s hats where youll see the real randia  think weve got more opinions than information actually s this thread a joke ll of us are

or you decide your job is in the area where you want to make a difference   eg education  defense  lawyer        politician   you contact an  and take up a cause   even if it is just one court case  and help in your free time t can be overwhelming to look at the big picture  but if you want to contribute  it must be one tiny action at a time ou can do it  we just need to focus on one action that we feel passionate about eg  feel passionate about education policy  so  will look for organizations people that are doing good and see what  can do to help r   am angry with corrupt politicians taking over forest land  look for organizations who have filed court cases against them elieve me  there are many e just need to make the effort and look  believe that this is the only way  rather

police reforms and judicial reforms   is for big people like journalists and often the data received from    is used for sensationalism   f you have want a safe and secure society  police reforms will pave the way ood luck  was hidden in mantras bro how could you forget that tart a personal revolution ake friends and become powerful ot in a thug like manner earn to change your environment with the small things first he things that are in your control mprove your condition bit by bit but consistently evolution doesnt make sense unless you want to overthrow democratically elected government  s that what you want to doest way is to politely educate people on why you think ndia deserves different leader ou need to be vocal about sensible issues like government raising taxes and causing panic among  and shut up about idiotic comments from rump hats what the antifascists are doing in the west  dont see a sudden revolution happening in our country e should be ready for a long  slow and multilayered approach to bring about the changes in our societyespite the reprehensible ideology of   one thing that  admire about them is their network of volunteers spreading their agenda of hatred so efficiently like viruses ltimately  this is an ideological war f we want to win this war  we need to spread our ideology erhaps we need a grassroot movement  and perhaps we need to replicate this concept of morning meetings in hakhas  where we can educate youths about the idea of a liberal and secular ndialso  we urgently need judicial and police reforms ich and connected today can flout all the laws without any consequences rores of cases are pending ften it takes decades  for a judgement to be delivered itigants often die before judgements are pronounced in their cases nfortunately  these important points are not election issues f elections can be won in the name of religion  caste arithmetic and pseudonationalism  then why will our political class ever bother to tackle these pressing issues e need a revolution without it ndia will only get worse there is no doubt about it veryone said after  won that their biggest upper hand was of their grip over social media so imo we should focus on social media as everyone is there even old generation on fb#x200 to change people mind the best option is to show them an alternative because without that people will say if not modi then who  and imo if we look at political parties the best alternative is  as that party was made after a revolt and most people in delhi are also happy with their work if we look at lalu  mamta  mayawati etc etc i dont think they are a better alternative#x200 so to make a change we can target where most people are there like facebook or twitter and make some pages which shows what are fake news and people in that group should target other groups to change people minds we have to talk in a certain way that will make them realize what is happeningto target other groups make post about comparison between alternative govt and current govt   and what developed countries provide like sweden and what modi does  basically comparison about positive things and modiand make memes and videos of modis previous promices and now find a nickname for the current government for making fun and critizing them share links in their groups critizing the govt and people from our group should upvote it to make it seen #x200 to sum it up we should critize the government in a way which makes people realize what is happening  on major issues which they cant ignore  and should do this in groups  giving each other upvotes so the post does not die  and if you find ideas share everywhere you can#x200 add suggestions if you have any reat revolution post  aza aa gaya odi hai to mumkin hai  removed

as whatever  think good and intelligence as agreeing with me aenerys argaryens are abundant  dont wana jump anybody ust curiousajasthan has ruling party ongress  still how did they not win even one seat his is the best result that could have happened  sucks real bad  plus they dont bring anything to the table oting for   just means voting for one family with only a vision to get re elected  nothing for the nation he congress should ditch the andhis if it wants to have any future y generation has no place in our hearts for them quite simply  s for a strong opposition    made that space

running water projects in poorer areas  which made up for the weaker macroeconomic factors ow much truth is there to this  am kind of surprised that why some people  read opposition  was not able to gauge the scale of the expected win mean odi may not be an autocrat but he seems to get some shit done jjwala ojna  udra ojna and  were delivered to people in much more efficient way than the past

also yushman bharat is also popular among lower income group people  odi not only able to kick off these schemes but also able to take them to people directly  like in our house maid was happy and in village women were happy by getting gas cylinders instead of daily cowdung cakes processame goes with isan farmers received their 1st installment directly in their accounts before elections his is what happens when you have no credible opposition and a bunch of corrupt to the core and greedy regional parties oping for iyush oyal as inance inister ongress gained at the expense of nonaligned forces o  the mahagathbandhan was a massive failure  has one seat less as compared to 2014  won 303 seats this time hat was their tally in 2014 as it 336 or 352 in 2014   think yushman harat pushed a lot of votes in ier and ier cities towards  ny opinions  nly person who could have taken on odi was probably marinder ingh ou want to use nationalism ell  marinder served in the armed forces ou want

clear message to to  that people just dont see ahul andhi as a capable leader who can solve ndias problems  removed   it looks like the  will finally get a majority in the ajya abha by 2020side from overblown fears about mergency and changing the onstitution  itll enable them to pass longstalled bills like the and cquisition eforms and riple alaq ill f you consider politicians as entrepreneurs like  do   we can see that  is a party  organisation  of first generation entrepreneurs who got their big break  funding  during the mergency or the am andir movement hile the opposition seems like a tepid slow organisation of third   fourth or in case of the congress  fifth generation entrepreneurs his manifests in the energy levels we see in the two organisations hile one is all about hustling and getting things done  some of which may be wrong   the second is plagued with unnecessary overhead costs that have no marginal utility whatsoever ither the promoters step back and let a professional handle the organisation or this will not end up well for them astly   this is a new ndia e do not dream about government jobs e dream about startups e dream about doing things  which may be wrong   e sure as hell hate the status quo o regional parties lost the mostve always felt we need more diversity in the arliament  but it seems that thats not what the most of the country feels think the politics of appealing to the weakest and the backward is over aybe weve really moved on from being a primarily poor country and moving towards being a middle income country n which case politicians will need to change their tacticsn this regard  odi is the only one speaking to peoples aspirations veryone else is still stuck at hand outs and government programs  guess that isnt enough anymore nd its as if  and all the other party heads have missed the memo ijliadakani is not enough anymore ambit atra lost or on ant trust the media these days iding the e first wagon they have stopped verifying sources https  iimgurcom jk3jpg  https  iimgurcom jk3jpg dite ost magine instead of working on policies ambit atra shouting in arliament andir ahi anega  removed  odi won election massively not just because of his work and performance but also because of the failure of ongress and especially ahul andhi hopefully they stop blaming the  and find out the real reason behind their biggest defeat and serve the country his might be the time for  to start delivering their worth he nation has shown trust  and its not something complicated that is needed  although it is hard his election also shows a massive gap in the absence of a reasonable 3rd front  hope the next election gives us some semblance of it at a national level  that people who connect can hopefully get behind or eg   has no clue what theyre doing t all points to the fact that we dont have a good 3rd alternative emocracy wins only when there is a ruling party and a nonsenile opposition party working towards development with a northstar focus pproach might be different  but things will be thought through m not discounting what  is capable of doing  but their momentum is very high now n influential opposition will ensure they dont derail e cant say the same now ahul must resign ny ideas on how many for   who d say with finality that this is the end of uslim appeasement in ndiaf those of you that maybe have a better clue than myself could please chime in on what this means for slamic populations in ndia and whether there would be a more dramatic mass emigration of these populations to more slamfriendly countries  deleted  hat  disliked the most was the opposition leaders claiming voter fraud when exit polls showed things look grim for them ust be gracious and dont let the efforts of   the security forces and thousands of people who worked to keep this election free and fair be clouded like this ur  gives training and seminars around the world to newer democracies on how to conduct elections hey must be doing something right he bad thing in all this is the opposition does not know how to oppose ongress  mc psp are people who have been in power for quite a while hat is also a problem with modi  ut the difference here is we see is the process in which was able to acquire such leadership is through hardwork o not get me wrong the guy is shrewd and conniving and will do anything to crush he unique factor is that he knows it is not his job to crush t is ours e have the ability to take power out e knows that and now it is proven that having money and connections dont matter ther parties lost because of one thing they continuously forgot about our power  has fault in many way and right now in my opinion the majority voted for  is because of modi and his potential he way the centre has been working now is astounding ue to the 2014 election  wished to become an ias officer nd one more thing you should understand eople are not stupid anymore ok sabha is a different beast and assembly is a different beast  live in aharashtra and  a way  can imagine aharashtrans not voting for  hat people are scared about now is the uncertainty  knew they will win but not by this margin his chat reminded me why  came on reddit o stay away from ndian keyboard warriors hanks for reminding me   ucking delhi people tishi worked so hard for them and they voted for some cricketer 50+   dont care if this wasnt state election  hope  loses in next election and they shut down  hese people dont deserve true politicians ts not worth fighting for such people at all et them have actors and cricketers ow is  1  thought they did better than before he land of selfrespect movement  amil adu  sends two mbedkarites  four communists  one of whom is a ahitya cademy award winning writer   and three women writers to the parliament eft politics should have been almost decimated with just one member in the parliament  but talin saves arx in  and sends four communists to the parliament an anyone give an insight into why  lost in ndhra radesh  his  https  imgurcom a ugj  is the fficial ssembly wise result tabulation for oradabad ok abha onstituency  had a significant role in propelling  in ssam pinions  ouldve been good for the nation if ongress didnt lose by such a large margin  was expecting a 40 majority votes for ongress and 60 for  his crushing defeat is bad  party shouldnt have this much power tll only raise their arrogance to the peaks hat little fear of people might not vote for me next time if  dont try to do be a good leader is what kept them in check  think congress is dead ike this year they hunt people to stand for lection and next election there will br free seat to contest under their party banner eally what break trust at exterme level rather than courrption for an    ndian people ust want to ask a question odi took advantage of polarization hats definitely one of the major reasons behind his landslide victory   apart from presence of an worthy opponent etc  ut polarization means presence of at least two poles ho created these poles odi r were these poles always present in the common mind and odi just added fuel to it f it was present before  who actually created this pole nd accepted indutva is one of these poles  but from where the other pole is coming s far as  know  odi is promoting  or taking advantage of  the indutva pole  but from where this other pole is getting formed  or has already formed   cant speak for everyone in  but the folks i know in my area of   richy  voted against  because of increase in communal tensions and demonetization  all the  supporters i know in  are upper class brahmins his election is a watershed moment in ndian history elcome to the ew ndiaust to put this into perspective  this win makes odi a democratically elected leader voted in by almost a half a billion people  a genuine and credible mandate et that sink in for the moment ust from the backing perspective  he is bigger than andhi  awaharlal ehru  kbar  rithviraj hauhan or any other historical figure in ndian history ndia has not seen such a leaderor good or bad  ndia is going to change dramatically over the next few decades t will be a far cry from the ndia that we grew up in  part ocialist part apitalistic  looking for an identity  a place in the world ur children will grow up in a completely different ndia which is for all intents and purposes already a indu ashtra o constitution change is needed s odi pointed it out in his speech yesterday  secularism is now a dirty word and no politician can use  or abuse  it anymoreit by bit  odi will consolidate power  just as i  utin  rgodan and all other authoritarians before him ith no credible opposition  he will do everything to keep himself in power  including destroying the very institution which brought him into power  the  lthough  do believe odi has the right interests at heart and wants the best for ndia  hes a politician and selfpreservation

ayalalithaa in the past odi image building was from the same playbook in fact  creating a larger than life persona ducation has nothing to do with this his is solely a lack of critical thinking and

become a battlefield for 2021 elections given the results in ok abhat looks quite funny when odi talked of inclusivity yesterday when his entire campaign lacked all those things is twists and turns

245,omething about ahul andhi hit me hard https  wwwredditcom r india comments bokvwa something about rahul gandhi hit me hard   ost of us would have hung our heads in same after being called apu 247 but that guy has the balls to come out and face the crowd  also lost my dad when  was 21  es his hate congress and  bothut  never got the unwarranted hate towards   and more so  towards ejriwal  get that ndian politics isnt a clean haven  but ridiculing someones identity and making a joke out of everything related to that person  is taking to another level applaud  for not giving up and still facing the crowd and the camera  with such calmnessnd frankly  his recent interview with avish  made me realize hes wayyy better than odi t least  hes open to criticism and questions honestly  whoever wins this election  ahul andhi has become a commendable person in my eyes dude got balls the size of domes to be shamed publicly to such an extent daily in an out  and still act as a statesman of high order e can use deaths of his family and honestly get a lot of sympathy votes  but he knows that would be biggest disrespect to their lives  he may not be a great politician  but he is a great person imo is steep learning curve and resilience are actually inspiring he interview with avish umar he says  ahul andhi has to be eliminated  and  must channel the publics mandate  hat is a very deep and en panishadic thought ll the humiliation against himself and his mother  calling her waitress euphemism for prostitute   he took it in stride and really grew is message is about inclusion and love e readily admits his mistakes and is willing to learn nd his assertive nature is very evident in his interviews f youth in this country are looking for a life lesson this is the guy n the other hand we have the hate spewing odi whose life message is when you mess up dont own up and instead keep distracting by criticising others  want to ask bhakts if their children would keep blaming their failures on others would they not teach them to take responsibility his character deficiency becomes a virtue on odi trange times we live in ot a ongress or  supporter    everyone use this acronym to save time    but odi wouldve gained so much sympathy by crying in his speeches if something similar had happened to him  dont admire ahul but  absolutely hate arendra odie is a grade 1 dumbfuck hey call him that because 90 of ndians love making fun of others in a very mean way rimitive omo rectus culture is well and alive in ndia hey even make fun of  grad ejri because he wears mufflers  coughs and doesnt wear suits or what not  too lost my grandma when  was 15 he used to talk to me everyday till  after 3 years  still feel like shes been talking to me every evening over the phone here might be about 99 things wrong with ahul andhi but his ever ive p attitude is worth noting bh  found riyanka andhis speeches much more compelling ame for ejriwal haracter assasination is an old but effective trick o people saying odi wouldve used the shit out of this if it happened to him  t is also worth noting that odi has never appealed to people due to his  status  think he uses the chaiwala status because it creates a better story  thats it  e went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves ou lost me with this line #x200 ad for him and riyanka adra to go through the deaths assassinations of their grand mother and father at such young ages and yet come out as decent individuals  olitics aside  were all humans in the end n this election  aa is clearly the lesser of two evils ut lets not get carried away e is a greatly privileged individual who got far more chances in life than any less privileged person would get after so many fallures he appu moniker is a creation of the  media cell  and ll be the first to admit that it is somewhat exaggerated ut lets not forget that aa helped them a lot because a lot of his quotes are ridiculous ow if youre thinking that odi is just as much of a gaffe machine   agree he ongress simply has been unable to sell this idea as effectively as the  has sold pappu thoughure  the man currently sitting in the  chair is a national disgrace ut not jump on the aa sympathy train just because of that  agree with you but if politics is giving a shoulder for somebody who have suffered a lot then it should be given o one denies that he suffered a lot and is not a pappu etc ut instead vote him for his vision  etcoting him this way we will do the same thing as when ndia did by giving odi votes because he was a chaiwala once ahul andhi is nice humble dude but wants to maintain status quo ever though of it in that way  thank you for bringing this up ets cut the bullshit e was and continues to be part of the corrupt status quo political class  that includes the ruling party ike every other politician  he will say anything to get your vote uck ongress  nd uck  he andhis are all about power hey use the surname to invoke positive feelings that people have of ahatma andhi and talk down to us during every election  ot to mention   and ongress play identity politics to stay relevant all the time  e has no other choicee is ajiv andhis son so naturally he had to be forced by onia andhi and other andhi family loyalists to step up to the plate and take command as the leader of the party otherwise it will someone overambitious who will hijack the party and marginalize the remaining andhis from the party  sympathize with aa t is difficult to cope with a loved ones loss  let alone to a brutal murder ut this isnt something unique to him here have been riots and terrorist attacks across various cities in ndia and the people there had to literally go back to the same places where other people or may be a relative lost life  spirit of umbai  lol  t least  had alternative to go to  and get away from this ut most of the country did nothile its pretty shameful what  is doing with exs long dead   dont see a problem with people calling him pappu hats criticism of his thoughts and actions and he is responsible for it n 2014   made odi look much better and this time its the opposite t 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with t 21 his father was blown up by terrorists e didnt even get to see his fathers body one last time either of them were saints or innocent victims ahuls dad got blown up by the same terrorist group   he and his mother ndira  started funding and arming in ri anka  starting a bloody civil war that went on for decades with over 15 lakh casualtiesahuls grandma was killed by her bodyguards as a result of the ikh insurgency she herself fomented by propping up hindranwale and his separatists in unjab as an alternative to the kali al t took another decade before the situation in unjab was normalized ot before tens of thousands of lives were ruinedot to say it wasnt harsh on ahul ut the phrase hoist by your own petard comes to minde went up and tried to become a leader that the country deservesahul didnt try to become a leader anyone deserved ntil his coronation last year he had spent over 15 years in politics refusing to take up any position of responsibility e refused to be a  or a member of s cabinet e refused to be  candidate in 2009 and even in 2014 wasnt officially named as such es only taking up these roles now because onia is too old and has retired leaving his party with no other choices nd never used pity politics to gain votes id you even follow his 2014 campaign e started it by giving speeches where hed remember being angry when his grandma was killed hich made everyone cringe because that immediately led to the 1984 riots which he refused to address  ed complain about trivial things like how his mother scolded him or how ndira made him eat all the vegetables on his plate e was the epitome of privilegend this time he hasnt hesitated to exploit even issues of national security for his gain e and his party have repeatedly tried to attack the upreme ourt and   going against the advice of senior lawyers in their own party heyve tried to cast doubt on the armed forces over the surgical strikes  airstrike and even ulwama attack e personally hounded and harassed anohar arrikar while the latter was dying of cancer  am quite sure  is aware of all thiso when people call him appu or make fun of his dads death  it fills me up with rage because when you take out the political figure out of him  he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life omething most of us will never or never did suffer in life his is such a vacuous argument his is the general election  not ig oss obody is voting for candidates for their sob stories  what people care about is what they are as politicians ots of netas no matter how vile their politics is are look like pleasant  charming  even charismatic figures when you meet them in person ve also read interviews of some journalists whove closely followed odi  think akar atel  who say he has a charming and witty personality and they get along with him personally but hate his politics ut nobody highlights or cares about that lso  most of his stupid image comes from him not being able to speak indi that well  think and also because he used to be a nervous public speaker e belongs to the most corrupt family in ndian istory ince ndependence  we have seen generation after generation this family has orchestrated a mockery of ndian democracy omebody has become ndias first prime minister despite not being the most popular one hen came his daughter hen came her son hen came his wife hen came her son his son turned out to be not so effective  so came his sister here does it end eople now seem to be waiting for riyankas son to grow up so that he can ascent to the throne e should be ashamed of ourselves for this servile mentality his family has transformed the grand old party into a family affair n which part of the world a party presidents job remain secure after an election debacle like 2014 verybody else in this world has to prove himself or herself in order to enjoy power  it seems rules are different for andhi familyhen would we learn to teach our child that no matter what his her family background is  he can be prime minister of ndia if he really deserves it he truth is we never deserved independence from ritish ycophancy is in our blood ervitude is in our  e always longed for a king  a mighty king who is not a common man  so that our king can rule us and we can concentrate on our daily affairs emocracy is not for us et us declare ndia to be a monarchy and put ahul andhi in her throne  this would satisfy a lot of people  guess  feel ashamed to claim our country to be a emocratic one f ahul andhi wasnt andhi and just ahul  ould we still troll him the way we do now ust a genuine question  e went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves nd never used pity politics to gain votes e is there because his title is andhi es even using his sister to win election earing defeat his sister eventually run away hat a disgrace ou have very little or no knowledge of ehruandhi family indly dont promote this family membersongress has completely failed against odi duo gang  cant even talk cohesively for 30 mins about demonetization  or botched  or current economic situation  unemployment  farmer issues  healthcare  education  international relation  etc here are so many issues  but he cant talk with a alternative plan ike odi  most of his answers are scripted and they are boring e himself out on bailongress has no vision  other than its dynastic demands f ongress has to survive they need to find out another  or  hey need to reject andhi family and reinvent itself m no fan of modi and  align with a lot of ongress recent policies but come onnd never used pity politics to gain voteseally ve seen him mention that story multiple times at many rallies when hes spinning off his m all about love messagewhen you take out the political figure out of him  he is a person who suffered too much too early in his lifehis is called an appeal to extreme fallacy ome one or two among a million  hit below the belt and make fun of his dads assasination  making fun of his dads dumb policies doesnt count  t happens in public life ou cant use those extreme examples to justify the opposite extreme  which is that he is now magically good and deserving of sympathyes a rich tosh who had a tragedy heres plenty of others with much worse tragedies who dont use those to gain sympathy like he does  so cry me a river ust a couple of decades ago  people had to go to jail and face torture for having a different political beliefeople laugh at him because he wants the highest job in the country with no qualifications or management experience  without even visiting his constituency for years  and he doesnt even seem to want it himself ou cant just spin the story around and say that everyone laughing at him is now an asshole because his dad was assasinated hose are two different things  dont support ongress  but lets not insult or let neech aadmis insult and hurt those soft spotslol the irony of it anjiv and ajiv were responsible for the deaths of thousands of minorities ajiv sent the  to meddle in ri anka and got nothing to show for it  was accused of war crimes t is best not to talk of ndira who though ndia was her jagir  have no sympathy for ongress or ahul for that matter but that doesnt mean  will support   have had two deaths in my family too one can recover eenagers are more resilient than people think y take away from that trauma was that if you give up at that stage  it will be your own fault  and no one will be able to help ee  have thought of this  but the issue with that notion is that he doesnt know how to talk or connect ou have such a huge connect via this story to the ndian population but you donte is plain simple not smart enough to be a leader and lives off his name  joke this with my friends in whatever way aa is perceived with his being bullied around  being sent to a foreign boarding school at a young age and his episode with his ad and randma he can change the perception any day nd with that image  he can easily become the  ou do bring some good pointsagreed  e deserves respectowever   am done with dynasty politics e cannot afford to have the prime ministership passed on as a royal jewel ook o many political leaders faced such issues throughout their lives o many have overcome their problems and we have to respect them ut consider the privilege ahul andhi has e has a very powerful family who will swoop down to make sure he leads a luxurious life ow many of our common people have that is only qualification is that he is son  grandson of two s and he hopes to become the  just because of his tragedies here are other leaders who worked their ass off for their political careers hey deserve better his is not the medieval age xactly  i truly despise modi and his party of goons and fear mongering buffoons  but at the same time  i see no future with  becoming   dude has no credibility in regards to that  only if congress looked past their dynasty politics and made someone like shashi tharoor the  candidate   would vote for congress in a heartbeat  think you are mixing a lot of things here nd  agree with you that todays politics has reached new low levels and all our politicians are indulging in is mudslinging  and no constructive discussion is happeningow to my disagreement with you  on his family being dragged into the political debate1 is father is a former politician and that too a former rime inister  who has contributed positively and negatively to the country1 is grandmother is also a former politician and a former politician who oversaw one of the darkest periods of ndian emocratic history1 ongress and ahul continue to ask people to vote for them using the ajeev  ndra  ehurus namesecondly  on people calling him appu1 his is a guy whos parent  grandparent  great grandparent were rime inisters of ndia1 y virtue of above points  this guy has had access to best education  and life that can be offered to an individual1 his is a guy aspiring to become the rime inister of this country1 e struggles to talk and convey an idea or thought while talking1 e is unable to come up with olicy oints and defend himself have had a good education and work in a relatively good area onsidering that he was supposed to have a better life than me   do have an expectation that he will be better than me in order to become the prime minister o yes   will make fun of him when he fails so miserably s it double standards yes  cause  do not have such high expectation of odi  considering that he is relatively uneducated chai wala and is a cattle goon uck off rue as a person  believe he went through a lot  but imo  just cant see him as a leader ongress should break away from silver spoon leadership and give others a chance pretty sure there are competent leaders inside ongress party way deserving than ahul    now dont come at me with whataboutism regarding with odi veryone is like what about odi then lets be clear even if you hate him he play politics well ahul  dont its simple as thatow coming back  think in coming year riyanka can be a good leader but still  dont know if  can support silver spoon fed candidates over people like rvind r even odi  can only imagine the pain he went through e is in politics and nothing is spared here think he was thrown into politics too soon and his lack of experience in his initial days reflected in his speeches and handling of party work ongress needs a strong leader at this time and  dont see ahul becoming one anytime soon f  am being honest  dont think he is really made for politics  dont think much of his political activity  so far   but not one politician in ndia has been scrutinized  derogated  ridiculed and underestimated  as much as he has been fter all that  he is still around  making socalled master politicians tetchy  annoyed is just great to watch  has the balls to come out in public and answer tough questions nlike somebody we know here is a difference between personal life and ruling a country i also lost my dad when i was in class 6 that doesnt make me eligible to be so sort of leader that is my personal life s a person ahul andhi is strong and i respect him but when it comes to ruling a country the case is different  deleted  ts really cool for the  to empathize with ahul andhi   never even though of his past and how strong one might have to be to move forward from that hat being said   dont like the appu comments not because  support him or think he has the mettle to take on any kind of a leadership role but rather because it does an absolute disservice to the democratic process in ndia y calling him appu  we glaze over his incompetence and inexperience omeone mentioned earlier that he never had to work for the position and  think that its really important for people drill that into their headsasically the outcome of the political scenario is1 he only major  noncommunal political party is being headed by someone who doesnt seem to have any achievements of his own other than being born to the most powerful family in ndias history2 eople still think that because his last name is andhi  he has some kind of a privilege to represent the nation hese days  honestly think that odi is a more accurate representation of what our country is than anyone else   am absolutely disgusted by this thought  btw 3 e either sympathize and excuse ahul andhi or utterly humiliate him e dont set attainable goals for the opposition  nor do we converse about what needs to change with all the parties playing the field ts always bad vs incompetence4 ocking of leadership roles based on nepotistic mythological values is what has deprived the country of countless leaders  who could have actually made a difference in their communities his system has blocked individuals access to both resources and potential accidentally hit submit hat doesnt make him a good leader#aenerys olitics shouldnt be a family business ull sympathy with r andhi ut he has to learn about the country and countrymen a lot e might have to learn to become a visionary from other great leaders either domestic or international heir is learning curve involved he has to go through with it15 years down the linehe will be a good one to qualify gor s post t the moment he should lead himself to be a great visionary  am  congress supporter in any way though otally nonspecific to ahul andhi  but  heard he is running for  from two different constituencies f sohow why is that legally possible appu to rabhakar es actually made an effort this time udos to him o matter what ppl say andhi name is keeping congress party together his is their only glue an you see the difference here rince harles and rince arry lost their mother too ut their country poured lots of love to them  close loved onesho are already in short supply for people in his positions nobodies can turn to a lot more people in our circle  relatively eriously thats what i was thinking  ahul ji made lots of sacrifices in his life time and lost his family members in the process  but still look at him is love for our country is astonishing fter all the tragedies he still want to serve his country what a legend he is truly our inspiration hanya ho vo aata jisne iss saput ko janam diya  removed   never hated him but thank you for making me realise this hard part of his life that most of us have forgotten  removed  nd this is something i dont know how the fucking hell nobody understands ut india is ready to insert logic in modis radar statement  can see some very great scientists and engineers of our country are getting really offended here  s inspector ordon would say ts because ahul is the rime minister ndia needs  but not the one it deserves o well hunt him ecause he can take it ecause he is a silent guardian  a watchful protector  dark knightf you actually think of it ahul and ruce ayne share a similar character rc oth of them lost loved ones  are rich  compassionate and fight goons who want to destroy their respective worlds after all lso if there roles were changed between modi and ahul  im pretty sure there wont be a day without modi saying my dad and grandmother sacrificed their life for the country  vote for me rrespective of how bad your dad is  this is a horrible thing to happen to any kid while growing up  i respect ahul for that  odi would have made a hashtag out of it by now and gained sentimental votes   dont support ongress o harm in supporting congress this time nough with s change  removed   really appreciate your post  thought same things but when  shared it with my friends they showed me a video where  says about potato machine ut one should never forget he never used his fathers death as a tool in politics  no matter how inexperienced he is eople who has lost parent would understand this ts pretty clear for me  if somebody would have asked me who would you hang out with ahul  hands downodi is the uncle who just comes into a party and looks around while everybody gets creeped out and stay silent till he leaves  removed   removed  ever thought about this hank you for pointing it out ell said ere  take your gold  removed  ro watch akame ga kill e went up and tried to become the leader that the country deserves dont support ongress ude  really  maybe he has gone insane but we dont know about it formally ight be off topic but  think ahul andhi is similar to aenerys argaryen oth have powerful fathers who had been at the helm of power

249,ts time for ndia to move from a indutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one https  wwwredditcom r india comments btkyzh its time for india to move from a hindutva   1 re you anywhere else other than facebook2 ont you think umanism is a highly misunderstood word and it might only drive people away if getting people to you is your idea3  see you have a highly ambitious vision  though vague here  is really appreciable  will take a peek into it aaah  the walls of text just got 10 feet higher amn  that took a while to settle in  really like the fact that someone in ndia is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management few tips from my side1  td be really awesome if you had a subreddit  cuz acebook can become really bnoxious  what with all the meme pages  and all the hundreds of friends that people can have tleast with a subreddit  oderation is much more strict  theres pinned posting allowed  and well  theres a lot more control in general2  re there plans to set up a fort location  ie ne location constituency  that youd prefer to start with  and focus on first uz  think if youd start with one  you might slowly reach statelevel  which is more than enough to get the nations attention  like your long term approach nything is possible with tenacity and will power ood luck to you he trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of ndians as being culturally inauthentic he idea as presented simply is not ndian t is just an artificial and weird mishmash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history  2019   but it doesnt have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land is successful because they have a vision for ndia that  as per their narrative  is as ancient as our earliest recollections of ndia itself his vision is made of songs and stories and ods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of ndians consciousness and their understanding of who we are hey can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate heir imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nations history ake the icon of mother ndia or harat ata ome say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding uropean ideas  but every indu sees harat ata as just another instance of hakti  the mother goddess  which is an idea that has deep roots in the indu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices f this appeals to you  please follow this page and share the link  ndian umanist arty  https  wwwfacebookcom hendiannlightenment  f you would like to

to learn from  and replicate the successes that the  and the  have enjoyed to help ndia transitionhat  achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology eligion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale  without which they will not  feel its impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore  unless you use a strong ideology to unite people ut if you do that  it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose oreover  it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in ndia  ndividualism ook at the best countries across the world  they dont have any popular organized groups throughout the country he egan community is the closest comparision  can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant  adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community s soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual  it will lead to the same result he devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly  all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything  all at once herefore   dont think you should try to replicate their success ut  also dont know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner  really like this idea  and to be honest  was thinking of something like this myself d really like to join  or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions n addition  somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to ndians the same way that hindutva does and  believe their statement holds a lot of truth  is an example  so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses verall   want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol lease make a sub  not everyone of us are in  olice eforms are the key to unlock the ndias potential  ow else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in ndia f this takes off  itd be great   look forward to casting my vote for the h one day#x200 y only concern is   dont think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted indutva va ayate into power hats your views on orth south cultural divide   rights nd d like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place youd begin  a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually ndians eva  ut as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely  and perhaps for eternity his statement is similar to that of olocaust deniers aste system and discrimination are sins of ancestors  you cant say uslim are responsible  or reservation cemented caste identities would like to see study or source which says caste identities were less fixed before implementation of reservation in 1947  repeat  your statement is similar to telling ewish people that azis were not responsible for olocaust ou cant whitewash thousand year history his has led to zerosum castebased electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water  jobs  law  and order  etc nd the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castesandal politics came as reply to kamandal politics alits voted alu yadav because ranveer ena did yadav dalit massacres heck the links between murli manohar oshi and ranveer enaoverty in backward castes was reduced from 1991 ncidentally that was the time when caste based identity politics started our claims that identity politics has hurt dalits wont be accepted by even forward castes ver 70 years after independence the alits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world250 million dalits are richer than  and uslims heck facts e believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education ol  cant even  hen penniless immigrants enter candinavian countries  their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility ts not about education  its about equal opportunity ou stop discrimination and its enough for dalit progress his along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will  we believe  be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste systemow can you give justice to 70    when there is zero judge in supreme ourt from these castes hat about 90 supreme ourt judges being brahmins e also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many alits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community re you quoting umitra mahajan and her chocolate and kids comment about dalits on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves  of which there is no persuasive evidenceut there is persuasive evidence for that  ur approach would  therefore  be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched e would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order  till the trust levels are built up among alits  etc in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for allour assumption that   wont vote for you if you said anything against reservation is absurd ou have freedom of expression which dalits respect  is against reservation n engal and arnataka there are 24 dalits per state hole  victory in   arnataka  rissa was possible because of dalits ore dalits voted for  than ou should have taken advice from some social science professor before writing this td be really helpful if you added in links in your post lso  kudos to taking the effort to trying to make a change tleast  you havent given up like me  ow naive to assume that the social  economic  and political inequality is not due to caste and just by providing jobs every issue will be solved his is the problem of this sort of liberal  we all are equal  agenda  it presumes that opportunities are equally available for all hereas it overlook the fact that how alits and divasis are still discriminated and killed for even attaining some kind of social mobility props to people who read the entire thingt would be nice to add a tl dr in the end tho ou will certainly have support from nlightened youth who are of small proportionut ts gonna take decades for good amount of common people to support and follow your party  ike you mentioned its gonna take a long time ut  hope you progress swiftly umanist eh kaun jaat hai hat is your take on illegal immigration from angladesh  aybe a   at the beginning to give readers a vague idea about whats followed hats your take on hristian missionaries and slamic extremism ur philosophy is to leave the existing reservation system untouched  you lost me on that one f the reservation systen has not changed anything in 70 years  why should it stay onhy should we have a system where merit is not the primary criteria and group after ethnic group agitates to name themselves as backward  ats and arathas ot calling yourself an atheist organisation is fine and dandy because we know how scary that word is to the uneducated  but trying to exclude secular doesnt make sense ost of the policies your organisation supposedly stands for  can get behind  so  still want to see where this goes ood luck f you mean indutva as a religion  then definitely yes ut indutva as our culture race cant be removed from us ecause that is what we are veryone can practice any religion or adopt a newer one  but the race is not a matter of choice  is totally losing it by mixing indutva as a religion and indutva haratiya as a race f you are against affirmative action and reservation then that is terrible hows that you have put zero thought into your policies and are just rambling his is not going anywhere trocities against dalits are increasing and your solution is to take away the one helpful ladder they have ont lie   am from right wing but ll defect if you abolish reservation ou have my vote re you have an   at hance ou will not come to power even in 1000 years as your ideas needs people with good reasoning skills  asking questions was never encouraged in ndia awn    consider myself humanist  see few fundamental issues which  figured through lot of introspection hese seem straightforward but no one follows thesei  o not give freedom of speech to a group person who campaigns to demolish freedom of speechii  o not give freedom of religion to group person who campaigns to demolish freedom of religioniii  o not give property rights to group person who campaigns to abolish property rights iv  o not give human rights to persons who work against human rightsand so onriticism welcome his naturally eliminates commies  jihadis  anti fos activists  criminals etc and yet is humanist in natureogic is systems should have survival instincts else they die  however noble they may be t this gonna be a face for new  ,7

251,ow can  keep up better with ndian politics  news  and current affairs https  wwwredditcom r india comments bscvnl how can i keep up better with indian politics   ou are not supposed to know everything ust start reading ewspapers  youll automatically start picking up topics of interest and gain knowledge about them f youll force yourself to know about something just to make conversation trust me it wont work edia right now in this country is either paid for by one side or the other e are in a dire need of a neutral channel source  would suggest you try to balance yourself with opinions from all side  would suggest you to look for sources from both sides of the coin o not place yourself in the source which suits your view of the world most t would result in a echochamberlso  dont close yourself to the only nglish sources 88 of the country is not nglish speaking  would suggest to check sources of local languages as well disagree with the subreddit of  r ndia at many points but  still engage in this subreddit in a polite manner  r ndia is a good source for news ike  u igivequalityhugs   would suggest for you to research issues which are interesting to you  feel that if there was a detailed discussion about these topics   wouldnt be able to contribute much to the conversation and d like to change thatf you dont know anything about the issue  try to listen to what others are saying t may not be true but it will definitely give you a starting point hese are meant to only be suggestions  and heavily biased ones  buto ick a  good  newspaper  subscribe  and read it every day our definition of ood will be different from mine  but best to steer clear of anything imes of ndiaish  ie whose definition of news skews towards only ollywood  sports and politics hysical papers in my mind are much better  but epapers  actual subscriptions  not just the website  are good too  ead  good  books  on topics surrounding the issues discussed in the news othing happens in a vacuum  and everything has historicity hat historicity may not be evident at first glance  and so reading books that give you context will help you deep dive oogle things when you read them and you dont have context r  if you dont have time  write them down on a note or something and revisit them later  nderstand the rough difference between news  opinions  and events he event is the important thing that is happening ews is updates on the facts that surround those events pinions are interpretations by experts on the facts that surround the event ot all events are important  not all news is real relevant  and not all opinions are true  evelop your understanding from multiple sources ontext is important  facts are important  history is important ny one source will miss out on some of all of those three  se your head f something seems to good to be true  it often is so thats when you deep dive and do a little digging to understand what isnt being told to you his is the part where you change from being a passive consumer of news to an active participant in current events  ttend public talks  public panel discussions  book launches  etc that are in your area  if you live in a major city  a lot of them are masturbatory exercises in selfaggrandisement  but they usually have experts who have had time to hone convincing arguments that are worth listening to even if you dont believe them ultimately earn how to form your own opinion verything should be questioned ven if youre ordan eterson or en hapiro fan  be one after doing the proper leg work and thinking about what theyre saying onts o not rely on apps  blogs  and youtube channels pps will always shorten the information  so you dont get the detailed discussion at best youll get a few extra sentences to a headline that give you the wrong context entirely nhorts is a horrible app and it becomes very obvious when someones entire argument is derived from an nhorts piece  or for that matter  a reddit post  logs can be great sources of information perspectives that could otherwise be suppressed  but you need to be sure that you have the ability to separate the bullshit from usefulness here are blogs out there that unequivocally support demonetisation  for instance he same goes for youtube channels theres only so much they can dive into a topic  and theres a lot that goes unsaid heyre great for getting some background and as a starting point in some instances  but they cannot form the entirety of your understanding of a topic r rather  they should not  o not read a billion different sources ot all events have equally weighted sides  eg limate change  nd honestly  trying to find a billion sources can become exhausting ick a main source you tend to trust  and a few others to crosscheck o not watch  panels on a regular basis 99 of the time  the amount of time and energy you waste on watching a panel on  would be better served reading something o not use eddit as more than a jumpingoff point eddit is great as an aggregator of links that are useful  and its fun to talk to others and see what opinions people have about news thats happening  but its not a substitute for doing your own legwork ts an echochambery own imperfect means of staying current1  use he indu as my main source of information2 ve set up an  feed using eedly to access the ress nformation ureau website for government updates3  read a lot nd oogle wikipedia what  dont know  and then use the sources contained therein to go deeper when  have the time  this helps me when somethings happening on  say  witter  where  can find out whats happening without getting sucked into it 4  will very occasionally watch ok abha   ajya abha 5 ll always read links that friends send my way  because m lucky enough to have informed  friends so even if what they send is complete trash  its still trash worth having a glance at he old school way  newspapers and magazines specially the editorial sections hatever you do  dont use reddit and r india as a source to better understand ndian politics or news reaking biased as fuck ead the hindu and watch  shows the ig picture  indias world  policy watch and security scan s others mentioned  read newspapers nderstand differences between editorials  opinions and facts ead books istory  politics etc heres no one textbook that you can read and understand entire politics tart with ndias political history  read ndia fter andhi f you travel   recommend listening to podcasts t takes the weight off your shoulders of finding relevant topics he een and the nseen is a good podcast  ewslaundry has some good ones  afta and harcha oull only get a better understanding by exposing yourself to multiple ideas  newspapers  books  podcasts etc nd keep away from any apps that try to save your time nderstanding news and making sense of it takes time  theres no way around that pps that try to save your time will eventually turn click baity ision ias monthly current affairs  hey are concise and free of cost   am cereal readin papers dont work cause it functions with presupposed familiarity because they dont have infinite space so first you gotta contextualize it talk to people because there is no beginneroriented source  know of  except your smart friends slightly longer path correct way to read papers pick the biggest stories of the paper  doesnt matter which paper cover story of the unday et  etc strongly suggest the epapersjust select and oogle what you dont getanother pointer read up on past scandalsits a finished story  not one you have to watch unfold over weeks months  its got the most info on the underbelly if there is one  and it gives you greater idea about the economy and its structure  which does not change over decades slowly youll start being able to contextualise the lakh crores  the budget  get a broad overview of the industries  etc its a long path but an important one  m also just beginning it fucking genx left us fuckall in terms of infrastructure  pollution  population  we have to wade into their muck now ot sure if someone has already suggested this but podcasts are a  way to catch up on ndian politics and current affairs  listen to ews and iews and the ig tory oth of them are by the uint and regularly add short episodes heres also he een and the nseen which has much longer discussions he ragati odcast and anatantra are pretty good too alking ooks is one of my favourites hey invite authors and discuss their books opics are wide ranging ts by ndian xpress top browsing r ndia for news ou if want just news then

do strive hard to cover all sides witter d say begin with the foundation  ivics ou should know the basics of how the government functions  when and why we have elections  how the budget is voted on  which committees have power over what ust pick one like the   and get the general sense of how it works hen maybe look at the judiciary  learn the difference between the high court  supreme court  etc et the big picture first and understand how the country works rmed with this knowledge you will more easily be able to spot bullshit like for eg conomic reports  which are based on data collected from such and such committee census survey f you know that numbers are only generated once per year  its easy to spot a lie when a politician manipulates them to mean something else r how and when development funds are allocated o if a politician claims credit  youll know that those funds were allocated 10 years ago o many little things hen you can try to get into geopoltics and foreign affairs hat are the treaties that we are a cosigner on how have we developed our trade relations with other countries  etc hen maybe a bit about economics what is inflation  how does the  set interest rates  etc ou dont need to go super deep into every topic  aybe you can then go into regional politics hat is the history of the hiv ena   alliance in aharashtra and how the  plays into this  or the differences between the  and the  and the historical nature of their rivalry he only advice d give is dont get too caught up with current news t takes months and years to generate detailed analysis of things ry to stay away from these breaking news type articles  which are always light on real information hey only have superficial information of who said what and that stuff only matters if you care about drama  country doesnt work like a rickshaw where it can change its course at any given minute  its a giant slowmoving supertanker any events which might seem super important because people talk about them a lot  will eventually seem irrelevant because in the grand scheme of things  the direction of the supertanker didnt change even a bit  heiarin for far  ndtv    he indu for  ndian xpress

256,e are the nation of ardar atel  of andit ehru  of ahatma andhi  of al ahadur hastri  of ndira with all her shortcomings   of  arsimha ao  of the great ajpayee ow did we come to onia  ahul  and to mit hah  and odi https  wwwredditcom r india comments b4t1vr we are the nation of sardar patel of pandit nehru   hey are dead now e talk about the alives  e are the same nation e have realised that ndia doesnt grow because of politicians but inspite of them hey arent so important anymore and because they lost their importance  their shortcomings are highlighted more than their predecessors e are always led to believe that nothing ever works  dont like the current state of journalism and media  the discourse has gotten to a low point idnt expect it to be this bad tbh  he times they are a changin bcz in that era there was struggle for independence  current regime had nothing to fight for everything was gifted to them and hence taken for granted hen situation is tough   you get molded by it  ow its all politics and hidden agenda where nations priorities takes last place thats why this situataion  e are the people responsible for it ast always seems better than it is  anmohan saved the country at least twice from immediate impending disaster  once in 1991    and again in 2008  asab  by not going to war  ont forget we successfully dodged two major global financial crises  1997 and 2008 veryone looks at the past and thinks there are great leaders there e spent 40+ years in an economic disastrous policy e should have changed course in 10 years but many people still think state socialism is the the greatest thing since sliced bread  fter few decades  depending on the govt in power these current netas will be portrayed in great honor in the school textbook retty interesting how you can disregard the shortcomings of ndira andhi  who came closest to becoming a dictator  but can call out onia  ahul  mit hah and odi n any case  intellectual capacity is not the unit if measurement nor a requirement for the post of  ts their ability to connect to the masses ost of these people have that  whether you like it or not odi in particular gives pretty powerful speeches  in indi  that are actually well crafted ts also funny how nearly everyone brings up ajpayee to claim some sort of neutrality in their assessment but he was voted out despite his relatively successful term  hats wrong with onia  ahul  mit  odi  e have a tendency to glorify people and events of the pastust because the leaders you listed are of the past doesnt make them all stalwarts or example  hastri was not a stalwart  although he was a good person and a good  for a brief period  ndira andhi was the original dictator he was the prototype of odi s for arsimha ao  if there is anything good is to be said of him  its his decision of liberalisation of the ndian economy is choice of anmohan ingh as  must be commended  too ut he is  above all  one of the wiliest politicians ndia has ever seen e was not a mass leader e was a ongress party apparatchikow for ajpayee n what basis is he being lauded now es  he is less despicable than odi  agreed ut here was a man who allowed the ujarat pogrom to happen  and  even more egregiously  made the most callous remark about the cause of the pogrom his man  like odi  was only good for ornate speeches othing else  nada or some reason  he and alaam are the most overestimated  hyped leaders of the pastow for the most glaring remark in your post  onia andhi rs andhi decided to stay away from politics after her husbands death nderstandably traumatised not just by her husbands death but the way he was assassinated  although the party leadership was hers for the asking  and later  presumably  the  post n her place  ao ruled for 5 years t the end of it  he didnt leave the ongress party smelling of roseseanwhile  the ongress party was ruled by all kinds of people itaram esri was the nadir undits had written off ongress as a hasbeen force in ndian politicst was at this time that socalled regional satraps like rjun ingh  hithambaram  nthony etc queued outside 10  anpath  beseeching her to enter politics t was due to their compulsion that she agreedhe rest is truly historic he was the opposition leader in the next ajpayee government he formed the government in 2004  ndian woman of talian origin was voted by the ndian people ruly remarkable he people didnt vote for anmohan ingh  who was not even in the reckoning  or cindia or anyone else hey voted for onia andhi ets fucking admit it he turned around the ongress party from the lows of 1997 to form the government in 2014 ets give credit where it is due nd was she a one act wonder o  she won again in 2009 ome critics may say it was due to the incumbency factor  just the same way they say that ajpayee lost the 2004 elections due to antiincumbency hatever fuck  it was a good government he won again  and  alas  flounderedeanwhile  odis propaganda had started veryone from otilal ehru to ndira andhis parentage was fabricated  even read some shit about how ndira andhis bloodline was of  wait for it  imurlane nyway  the propoganda worked hats why people of certain ilk and of certain generation seems to think onia andhis two successful terms  lets admit it was she people voted for  as some sort of a fluke hats why people fail to mention the remarkable feat of only the third leader in ndian history  after ehru and ndira andhi  to win back to back general elections to form the govt admit  have left out many moles and warts from this glowing account eel free to add it  but take away not the remarkable aspect  too as there corruption es  in oodles as there backroom buying and selling of votes of opportunistic parties  such as ulayam inghs es  in bucketset we must admit that it is indeed remarkable that a late  reluctant entrant to ndian politics  of talianorigin  and a woman  made a complete turnaround in the fortunes of ndias oldest political party within 5 years nd it is remarkable not only of her but of the ndian people  who  unlike some richer  more democratic  more educated nations  didnt think her gender or place of birth important when voting for her#x200  the leaders which you have mentioned as inspiring   were formed during the indian struggle for independence   they could have their difference is their approach   but they did want ndia as a nation to improve since politics at that time was largely a reserve of educated and rich   as a corollary to that they did not appeal to lowest of human emotions namely religoin  caste and class issues  and issues of education   infrastructure and health were used to fight politics nce that generation died down   the coming generation didnt have the moral values which come with living in the time of fighting for your nation  to win elections they resort to most common issues which everybody can relate to ie religion and caste#x200 this situation has gotten worse   with every middle class parents advice to their children that do whatever you want but dont join politics or dont do social work    just get a good job  house and get married #x200 eriously what do people think will change   with this kind of attitude#x200 #x200  ajpayee was a traitor that provided information to the ritish e also was the biggest contributor to the attack on abri asjid after dvanidit or people that dont beleive me  esearch who iladhar ajpai was and how the written testimony given by ajpayee and his brother put this freedom fighter in jail eople always get the leaders they deserve ndira andhi was by far the worst  of them all  and that includes both ajiv andhi and odi ehru ssly ndira andhi did good work but ehru was a pure moron,7

disaster coming o these reserves are just that eservesnd since rjit didnt bend  the government kicked him out ou think this was a resignation o  it was a firing that was timed to perfectionhe replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election newsr as with his masters in history will offer nothing but support to the governments ideasodi wants the reserves to come out  creating a temporary surge in growth e will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 lectionsf these things happen  he truly will have fucked up the economy m buying lube and preparing my anus emo 20 is right around the corner hey got as for one simple reason or the 1 lakh 3 lakh crore that aitley and gang are eyeing he request for that money to be given from  reserve  will come in a week or two n a month  therell be more loans being dolled out by banks  more mudi kaka posters  more photo ops  more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and fcourse

start with your friends  your domestic help tell them how it is done  counsel them not on which party to vote for but how it affects them  ets start something from our side to save whatever we have left  deleted  hat really worries me is that common people  or even educated people  or even the randia crowd dont seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be  hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to ost of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics   removed  es got a history degree and has no idea about the economics es a government yes man a puppethe government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability in return for short term gainshe movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky ude is  istory  ll his predecessors have been h in conomics and anking  e is just a ately lapdog   hy do you think r urian didnt think highly of  folks  they are generalists not specialists as will help with the looting  this is their second attempt at demo to financially hamstring the opposition and slurp the  reserve ur stewards have turned weak and spineless like heoden  reminder to everyone   asked ay to remove the  of aytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience nd now ately ji has brought in a no banking experience no economist  istory  to head  hey think we are retarded nd to reply to another comment  these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever  did an  from one of these ndian nstitute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually   and  hey just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate etting a h from ale or arvard or  involves original research work nd on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation  o economist worth their salt would have let this happen  m not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the overnor of  as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane lso  as other commenter pointed out  its the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the boardith all that said  its still a very bad decision made by the government  mean  its not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the eon to the core despite its serious flaws lso  his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something thats troubling regarding his appointment m supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in minds for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization   wont be surprised if theyre to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking o organization is devoid of factions but what weve seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division ut the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political  rather than being an economic or social onehis appointment is very much like the appointment of etsy eos as  secretary of education or avanaughs appointment to the  upreme ourt buse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated ets see how this will unfold in times to come  o me  it matters less what his academic or research credentials are  lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs hat matters more is that he is a overnment stooge otally agree with you r as has corruption allegations against him as well  re 2014  was eyeing implementation of basel norms  and now  itself is getting its pillars stripped  e was mouthpiece of government during demo ts election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power reserves will be used as election funds oan wievers  ect  ill there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to udi aka and log minister   dunno but  get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the  and his gangs nonsense and he will also leave enerally  historically  how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer aru will help to get over someone  othing surprising saar nmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp uys  hes an alumnus

vigorously  tax payers are fcuked hy do you bring the rape analogy here    r are we just following hard work  arvard bull shit  definitely do not agree with this he arvard passouts  have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments ostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be  dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not  ut atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in inance in  and ational nstitute of anking anagement e also had held posts in various government revenue organizations  ot sure  if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just  istory degree as  governor e seems to have some relevant qualification and experience e has experience in economics related field h in economics doesnt means that you should be selected ven aghuram  pursued  and later did  id he had an economic background from the start ohis guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work  know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least urns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his ikipedia page o be fair   is supposed to serve the government f urjit wasnt doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him ecause

age to hit a jackpot s  said   was 16 when we immigrated est thing is that ndian high school system is rigorous while in anada  high school is a breeze  comparatively   while universities are a significant jump in difficulty t your sons age  he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in aths and cience that is taught here in rade 11 and 12 ut he has to grab the opportunity as well f  were in ndia  the best  would have thought of was  college of engineering  or  niversity of aroda  yet  was able to do ngineering from niversity of oronto  which is better than any  eep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity  had plenty of ndian friends  but almost none of them took the opportunity  had done 11th standard in ndia  and had to do 11th and 12th again here f your son studied in ujarati medium  he might have to work hard initially  was in nglish medium f he studies all the way until 12th in ndia  a downside is that now anadian universities dont know how he measures up against local applicants  and now he might be competing against nternational applicants o  better if he is part of anadian high school system before 12th  e will likely have to give   academic module   regardless  btw  s ndian food available in tohn very small town in anada has it ut no guarantees that youll like the taste ften  ndian restaurants in remote towns

consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment  with no relatives around here are a few ujaratis in  now  oncton  redericton etc  but most are international students  so not sure how youd relate all me emotional  but it still haunts me that my future generations wont be able to communicate with me in ujarati if  remain in anada the rest of my life ot that they wont know how to  but they wont be comfortable n 23 generations  the language will be wiped out from your family lso  same thing about good values that might be unique to ndia  am still not at peace with this  and am planning on returning back in a couple of years me if youd like to discuss more e can chat over hatspp if youd like ou make the decision  but  can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience v gathered here in more than a decade  and that might help you make the decision our salary is quite low man  even for  ince you are going with a teenage son  who

ruin am sure thats what our founding fathers would have wanted  y father  let my country be led to ruin   s  enerally  think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes his is because fewer people have more power  and so can do bigger scams  and because they face less risks of repercussions  read somewhere that corruption in ndia really kicked off with ndira andhi

rindia my close friend cancer    know multiple people with s and hs who did an  in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields one of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities t adds a lot to your profile  depending on what field youre trying to enter enefits greatly in finance  investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting its a great move uckily for your friend  this is the first year that  has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so e might have to get used to all other students being half his age lol n a slightly different note uch a question wouldve been unthinkable in a developed country his is one area m genuinely envious of here should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning  hope he does go ahead and studies e dont have enough people actually willing to study   harapurs  entrance exams have aw programs too  now   did llb around 10 yrs back  not practicing  had a classmate 60+  only reason he did was because he wanted to learn more ery nice person  he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area raffic constable brought back his car  and said sorry to him lb 3 years course is for those holding graduation 5 years for 12 pass ttending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others   had 4 in my second year o attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted toohile studying and reading the cases is very interesting  practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income any of my friend still makes less than 10k a month his is where top law school matters f you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easy believe everyone should do lb o matter what you do it helps to know the law  law admits people only upto 30 years of ageot sure about the  it doesnt have a great rep though  a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties ost of what ve heard about  law course was the teaching is terrible  f he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income rent ancestral property  it can be a very good option nly the very few in ndia can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money n the other hand if you think of making money from aw after entering it at age 36  you are likely to be disappointedasy and quick money in aw is only in ransactional aw  ie drafting up agreements affidavits documents and registering them etc  and in consultancy advisory  eg being on a businessmans negotiating team while he they negotiate an agreement merger tieup with a potential partner  ransactional practice can be independent selfemployed as well  infact most lowlevel lowskilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license  rather than appearing before a ourt ou can make 3035  per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits  you can barely hope to make 15  per month from fighting cases in court ven the better known aw irms in umbai do not offer their freshers 3035  pm as starting salaryn area in itigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of olicitor irms   ew solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age he best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land rent independently practising aw in the ourts  ie actually pleading before a ourt hats how the profession used to be in rendependence ndia hy should there be any age limit to study geism is part of casteism  guess  there is no age limit for learningor preparation of   u may suggest this free  mock test site  https  wwwcybermocktestcom clat   f he already has masters degree why doesnt he just take a  exam and teach aw undergrad student from  atiala  herem sure your friend has a graduation degree  so  will not suggest going for   since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th he variants of these courses depending upon the  are   hon   c     etc5 years for a course is too much  when he can successfully pursue a 3years  degree  will suggest checking out  une    etcts a much better utilisations of his time and resources too  given that a fiveyear course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year  approx  if you consider the s and other top colleges would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through  ever too late for education and starting afresh aiming for a goaled just need to keep the eligibility criterias in check ay  know which city your friend is based out of  n my time at law school   have seen 4050 somethings sitting with us 20 year old kids ood thing about law is  it doesnt have age limits and or any retirement age ome state bar councils do have 45 year age limit   am not sure if it was challenged in court  but thats a nonissue t can be a task to learn nuances and practicalities of legal practice when youre 30 plus but its not a challenge big enough to be a roadblock for him to take up lawest of luck to your friend   study in a  affiliated institute e have never had anyone his age study here hats because  institutions dont have a 3 year  course e only have a 5 year   course or a   course o hell have to shift to another city for 5 years and go to class everyday with 1718 year olds sk him not to give clat and research about colleges which give the  degree alone or that  he should already have a graduate degree like   c or  any factors need to considerede will feel the age gap a lot  especially if in a 5 year program but also in some 3 year programs since many students join straight after college he exception to this is probably  and   mumbai he reason for that is attendance is not an issue and  still has evening batches hese attract older candidates who are working during the day and also  aspirants who have law as a back up our friend will find it easier to gel with the crowd at such places our friend might be able to continue working while studying ven more so if its a teaching job and its part time hose can be kind of chill and he is already working there  so cancerbased discrimination may be low egarding placements  recruiters will want cheap workers with no baggage ence  ageism crops up aw schools  all colleges for that matter  are factories and unfortunately  your friend will be an outlier e is highly experienced in diverse fields his is bad and good ecruiters wont know what to do with him or he will get a offer appropriate for a 21 year old t can be good if he finds a job that values his experience in ech   etc but that takes a lot of hustling to find et he will have to explain 4 years of unemployment ruth is  his classmates will be safer bets and his getting recruited through the formal placement process will be tough itigation stream is always an option ts slow work in the beginning but hed be self employed or in a small firmim being a cancersurvivor  if  were in his shoes  d opt for a college with chill attendance  continue with the teaching rite the  exams uild up contingencies for a cancer relapse  good insurance  access to healthcare  savings  hen carry on with life with the above priority  job with health benefits  low stress  and try to be happy  technically  age is no barrier till  itll be tough e should consider parttime and retain his day job t is doable ancer changes everything elapse is a risk that he will have to

299,he erala odel https  wwwredditcom r india comments 79u1il the kerala model   amn you    was expecting some mallu models   egarding the high crime rate in kerala https  youtube 26nou may skip to 345 very state has dependence on something  just think that erala does the right things with their money he risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving  and not just bijness related indicatorsheir economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly  tourism  gelf and angalore aybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependencyhe debate is very nuanced with guys like hagwati and en arguing the merits of ujarat and erala models ith economics  there are no right answers ts just whatever worksow lets take the other extreme  aryana he economic indicators are off the charts ut people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women ow is this development and is it sustainable erala started out with 47 literacy in 1951  at a time when  had 12 and the ndiawide average was 1833 nd why was so  being in anga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people  erala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society  nd still today  is a highly divided society or apanese miracle and their industrialization   their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  s a eralite   find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous showoff at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst e will be facing dire issues when the middleeast slows down significantly  personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf rade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve t wont happen overnight  but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can do really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown s of now  the only way  can sustain my current income if  move back is to go freelance  and that is being optimistic o be fair  a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist ust look at what amata anerjee is doing in engal  despite me hating her  she has done some good work in mgnrega  improving the hospitals from their dismayl state  and overall improving rural infrastructure he fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of engal too hen the eft left  we had a high debt of over 15 lakh crore  and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it y main issue with erala model is that it cant be implemented anywhere else t works for them  good  but we need some other way to lift other states  like breaking big states to smaller  and then working on them ikewise  we can produce replicas of oa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up  ne of the less spoken advantages of erala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities  believe factors like high  and low  are because of this ut regardless of what brought about its high development   think the erala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states f we are looking to emulate   guess the amil adu model of socialism has proven successful  may not be erala  but is often #2 or #3 on most counts gain  one advantage that  has had that a state like  does not is that adras has been a prominent administration city since preindependence ut  think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment  adicalization is a problem in slam itself  dont think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent uslim population of that number elsewhere  o you have a source for this hile  is raising legitimate points about eralas economy  you seem to be missing the whole point about erala model erala model is that t has achieved very high material uality of life human development indicators  despite being  low income statehe reason it is called a model is because it is unique retty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or uman development go handinhand but strangely erala anaged to improve material quality of life with little economic growthy arguing that eralas economic growth track record may be considered abysmal  though a fair point  you are only reinforcing the concept of erala modelobody calls erala an economic miracle  everybody knows it is not s it a replicatable model aybe not s it the key to solving the problems across the country efinitely doesnt seem like it as historic circumstances contributed erhaps ut historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too o that is argument that cuts both ways ow  i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom  ecause the impact of the gulf boom on erala really began only in the late 80s erala eclared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s  which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years lso some of the places with most gulf s  such as alappuram  are actually some of the most backward areas in erala  nd to give credit to the ravancore royal family is laughable  because if that were the case then many regions in outhern amil adu today was part of the  erstwhile ravancore kingdom hile  parts of the ravancore kingdom that is in erala have done extremely well  parts that are with amil adu have yet to catch up lso ravancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30 of modern erala t is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first erala government  which was a communist government o  what has the erla model achieved ewer children are dying  fewer mothers are dying  there are fewer illiterate people ore and more people are getting skilled  hence are able to find higher paying jobs  albeit  elsewhere  would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of erala model o  yes it is a model s it the best model it is hard to say as it its own advantages h yes definitely  he riot cases are high because almost everything is registered and reported  https  enwikipediaorg wiki okku kooline of the most ridiculous things  have ever heard of pvotesrabs popcornet the games begin  think best things that happened to erala were  rogressive ravancore state  arly ommunist government and lots of christian missionarieshristian missionaries and rogressive ravancore state meant that the state had a robust education system providing for a progressive and good labor base for development ommunist govt took land from absentee landlords and redistributed land among landless laborers lso  brought social parity by working against caste system ocial parity is very much a prerequisite for economic growth erala achieved is much earlier than otherstate couldnt take full advantage of its lead  but remittances or not  it did have a headstart on other states in early independence days  2 nemployment rate espite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs  the states unemployment rate is 125 against the allndia level of 5  making it the third highest in the country after ikkim and ripurarue ut like  i hate circlejerk and many others have mentioned  there is an aversion to blue collar work in erala ts not because of the unavailability of jobs ts not the best feature to have  but this happens in most emancipated societies his is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective   merits  sustainability of the erala modeleems to more erala thrashing than anything else ont see too many merits mentioned   erala has a lot of things going for it  and d rather be here than anywhere else in ndia ut it has its own challenges as well  just like any other statehat alayalis should do is to not gloat too much about how they are better that this or that state in ndia  but really look at where they are falling shorthe reality is that if the gulf money dries up  erala is fucked ither produce capital and expertise in the state  or leave your beautiful homeland to work in possibly unfriendly places for those who have it  hy so much unemployment in kerala   deleted   erala started out with 47 literacy in 1951  at a time when  had 12 and the ndiawide average was 1833nd that 47 started off from 0  thanks to eralas proclivity to open up and mix with other cultures he various social reformation movements  and influx of hristian missionaries among many other factors contributed to this ho claimed it was all postindependence ovts he  ovt though  made giant strides in postindependence erala through its  education bill  https  enwikipediaorg wiki erala ducation ct 1958  ct 6 of 1959    its not  all  post independence  but a  lot   was  post independence  nemployment rate espite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs  the states unemployment rate is 125 against the allndia level of 5  making it the third highest in the country after ikkim and ripurarue ut like  i hate circlejerk and many others have mentioned  there is an aversion to blue collar work in erala ts not because of the unavailability of jobs ts not the best feature to have  but this happens in most emancipated societies his is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective   olitical iolenceiolence is never a good thing  but olitical violence is slightly different olitical awareness among a population is generally considered to be a prime metric in considering the collective intelligence and societal emancipation of a region n erala  political awareness is super high his is often misused by parties  but political killings like what the     have been spreading  are super low he only political killings that do happen in erala are always        in orth erala hile these are highly condemnable  they are exceedingly rarend also  crime metrics are reported and recorded much more stringently in erala  thanks to a well functioning executive ou might remember a report about how candinavia had reported extreme high cases of sexual assault imilar situation  though high influx of migrants is also a problem there  otbed for  recruitementhis seems to be the most ridiculous of them all lmost right out of the  playbook uoting the exact same article youve quoted  ndias uslim population  the third largest in the world  has so far contributed negligible numbers to sis  fewer than 90 people  according to most estimates ore have gone from ritain  even from the aldives  than ndia  ure  ahhabism is a growing threat in erala  and more and more muslims seem to be drawn to it ut the absolute numbers here are abysmally small and cant really be considered a metric at all nd finally  the extreme dependence on remittancesemittances undeniably drive a bulk of eralas economy ouve provided good numbers  sure hat is your point though griculture and brain drain might be flipsides to it  but comparing to other states that  do  depend on griculture  isnt it better that people are employed abroad and are bringing money into the economy rather than flail about in abject poverty t is funding a flourishing society  and alayalis have built up vast business empires abroad nd are employing thousands of ndiansccording to this logic  all of the  engineers flocking to angalore  are bad for the nation  because they should be doing griculture  and not depend on the  for offshore development projects erala has a bunch of issues reatment and safety of women  fewer opportunities for employment etc are clear and present problems ut  seems to be more interested in painting a comprehensively poor picture of the state  misrepresenting facts ource  22 years in erala wants to discuss meritsoints out only demeritseah   is clearly unbiased hanks  s a eralite   felt that the whole eralaisbest circlejerk on randia was getting out of hand his was sorely needed 3 really lot of repetitive points sanghis are putting in lot of effort in researching about erala these days such sincere hardwork should be appreciated but cherry picking facts to peddle some agenda is not rightyou cant judge a fish by its ability to climb a treevery high population density is not suitable for manufacturing  related jobsuge pressure on land means less agricultural output  heavy dependence on imports extreme dependence on remittancesare you trying to spin this off as some sort of insult its not because it means human resource is the

rest of the country hat is not a negative mark2 e have the lowpay jobs the rest of ndia counts as employment e just leave those to outofstate workers e do indeed have a problem with not having the a

sitting ot badly written at all  saw the author went to olumbia to study journalism  it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance ts clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective  which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography ts taken some effort to put this all together  but its not a multi year ground breaking effort evertheless very timely  and shows the murky underbelly ala amdev is incredibly ambitious  and since ambition is violence  hes quite ruthless and violent ts a psych profile  probably true for many s and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies   http  timecom 32647 whichprofessionshavethemostpsychopathsthefewest  ts a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition lso an example of what yoga without yama niyama  dos and donts  can do  it can provide incredible energy for mischief ven before reading this   never trusted in amdev as a spiritual godman  but still didnt actively disapprove of him since  just considered him to be a businessmanut reading your post has made me realize that he is a pretty terrible human being who feeds off the faith of the gulliblehanks for the post mate ou have completely changed my perception  ew shit has come to light  do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this aba knows how to gain peoples trust and then punishes them for trusting him n a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknessesor example  hankar ev and aramveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose amdev t shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not his is fucking scary man uck   this is great  had always known there was something behind ajeev ixits death ust like he says to boycott hinese goods   think we should all boycott atanjali goods  angs of asseypur wali feeling aati hai story padh karhis is scary  side of this  empire o as expected  this baba is nothing but a fraud who built his empire on top of lies  deceit and murdershank you  omebody need to make a hindi  thanks for the summary  was looking for a kindle version and couldnt find great that you pointed to the app by uggernaut  businessman ow no

cologically friendly and swadeshi ny proofs in the book reat job  and nice summary ou have already done good work but if you added the timeline it will be more helpful in keeping things into

301, find  ndia circlejerking too much over hashi haroor whenever he reproaches the evils of the ritish aj ere is an alternative perspective from urcharan as  non political  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 6zeuk0 i find rindia circlejerking too much over shashi   ow  ow what a nice read ut there was no mention of famines or partitions ere they not backbreaking for the economy  deleted   dont think thats what haroor is really talking about ore from the perspective of itler is taught to be an evil guy now n germany as well et  ritain has mostly whitewashed the horrors theyve committed in what they teach to their own kids ontinuing the same stuff    hes raising awareness about the atrocities that theyve committed  and thats something  can get behind  think haroors main goal is to educate the modern estern masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism  that they conveniently leave out in their history text books his was an interesting counter narrative as well as essentially wrote the same thing in ndia nbound ut  dont think it really contradicts haroors claims  veryone of as arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ndia back but he lets the rits go cott freees  there were individual entrepreneurial success stories  too few benefited  es  the uropean institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes  the caste system was responsible ut without a ndian structural head who couldve changed things or we couldve had an enlightment  a historical whatif   the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth hat carries a lot of culpability he drain theory is definitely true he  was paying 400 000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the gifts to arliament all sourced from ndia hey took advantage of urgazebs tax exemption he arathas  awab of wadh and yderabads izam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the rench and  well before 1857 safuddaula paid 76 million rupees annually just to be recognised awab in 1797 he point is  the money couldve been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldnt be as poor as we are now book came out last year called elling mpire ndia in the aking of ritain and merica  16001830 which demonstrates the centrality of ndiaboth as an idea and a placeto the making of a global ritish imperial system ssentially  the new world was discovered because olumbus was searching for riches in ndia e makes the argument that in the runup to the merican evolution  the ast ndia ompany played a visible and disturbing role n his view  mericans awareness of the ompanys conquests in ndia  and the establishment of an authoritarian government there  evoked the fear of a shared place for ndians and mericans in a corrupt and despotic empire  ollowing the evolution  mericas connection with ndia paradoxically expanded  as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of ndian consumer fashions uch of it  however  arose fortuitously out of the extended ritish wars with rance from 1794 onward  as a neutral power  the nited tates was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others y 1806  ndia had contributed 4 percent of  imports  and mericans commanded much of the ontinental uropean market for ndian goods  t gave ndia almost a hundered years of peace m done  wouldnt call 100+ of looting and injustice peaceful ave read the whole thinghe ehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the ritish periodaking information from the article itself   think we can still blame the ritish for not letting ndia join the industrial revolutionhis they did by creatingow literacy education  n a modern economy  this alone will mean that youll fail to compete nstable political environment  low confidence  n an uncertain future  why will anyone invest time and capital  here is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason ndians didnt moved toward industrialization nd he also mentioned that ndians had no money to buy anything at that time hen how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed snt these things require time especially a skills gained after education  think once a generation of ndian educated enough in 1980s they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills nd of course we cant deny the poor government policies but  feel completely blaming them isnt right  a thing s there something wrong  have understood from this article aved for later oo long to read right now ets just sum it up he ritish did many good things and bad thingsersonally m glad for stuff like outlawing ati and reforming personal laws which m sure most of our post independence governments wouldnt have the guts to touch as ndia ever a rich nation in the first place eople use the 27 of world  stat to justify the label but we had 27 of the world population also at that time oth hashi haroor and urcharan as are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation  lightly off topic  but  believe much of haroors ritish bashing is just shrewd political posturing hen he first ran for parliament in 2009  the air community voted for him en masse because he is one of us he educated liberal class voted for him because he had the it factor  undersecretary general of the   erudite  sophisticated etc e won handily  with a huge margin n 2014  a lot of the older airs voted  because they stand for indu values  evidence for this is anectodal  everyone in my  +wifes  family voted haroor in 2009  most of our parents generation voted  in 2014  haroor still had the youth liberal vote and won  but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009  huge slide n 2019  he faces the prospect of running against uresh opi  popular actor  current      and stands a real risk of losing  consider his antirit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowdt is really simplistic to claim ritain looted us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of ndias wealth was concentrated in the hands of amindars  awabs and ajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the ndian subcontinent before the ritish brought it all together ell haroor is not completely wrong either ndia was rich  maybe not as rich as all those hatspp forwards mention like 27 of world  and other crap  also believe that haroors fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches  think hes going to use this wave of false patriotism thats been around which makes people patriots on social media  to his advantage in the next elections  mean  no one really discusses if a robbery is overall a good thing even if it did help turn someones life around in a positive way   he older generation fears it more than the young  whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the ests material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological oness ve been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides  accepting nglish  decolonization lad to see an academic agree  can drink his urine straight from source rilliant earned a lot about myself

305,hy is the proposed bail in clause not being discussed https  wwwredditcom r india comments 7hnc7h why is the proposed bail in clause not being   eposting from my earlier commentloomberguint explains it well herehttps  wwwbloombergquintcom business 2017 11 28 shoulddepositorsfearthenewfinancialresolutiondepositinsurancebill5 version ay you are a bank and you have given out money to several entities ay those entities are not able to return the money  so they become s hat can a bank do in this situation o a bail out  o a bail in  o bankrupt and close down he point of note here hese are the last steps that a bank  takes  there are several ways that the bank tries to recover money at first  selling the assets of the entity  selling the entity itself  issuing bonds to raise more money and avoiding bankruptcy  not issuing profits as dividends and absorbing them to solve s  downsizing and firing staff etc nfact  in the new bankruptcy laws which is already in place  the banks have the power to take over the entity and try to turn it around so that it becomes capable to pay off its debts ncase thats not possible  it can sell the entity itself and keep all the proceeds to itself  which is whats happening for some of the steel companies in ndia which form the largest s he promoters and owners of the said entity dont get any profits from the sale ith great bankruptcy laws  banks in developed nations are able to recover upto 60  of s owever  rates in ndia are low  only 20 of s get recovered ow imagine a hypothetical scenario where the bank has no other option but to use the last three options  discussed above o what should it doith a bail out  the tax payers of the country give money to recover the bank ith a bail in  the depositors and customers absorb some losses and give money to recover the bank ote hether a bail out or a bail in  its the people who are going to pay for the recovery of the banks lso note  every person who participates in an economy is a tax payer  whether of direct tax or indirect tax ow comes the interesting part  has insured all deposits in the banks to a sum of 1 lakhs o if a bank goes bankrupt  you are insured a sum of upto 1 lakh and you can claim that amount from  o what has changed in this law wo things he law has given the power to  to change the insured amount his is necessary because when this 1 lakh insurance limit was set  it was in 1970s and it used to be a big amount then  nsured deposits do not come under bail in  hich is why the title that banks can wipe out your money is incorrect hat changes for you because of this law reviously  without bail in option  if the bank was not bailed out  you could have claimed a maximum of 1 lakh from  as insured money ith bail in option  that remains the same  your insured amount of 1 lakhs is what you can claim if the bank goes bankrupt  n extreme screnio  banks can take your deposits and bail in with that to save itself owever  if that point arrives  a bank going bankrupt is more disastrous than a bail in ither way  people pay if bank get unrecoverable s  either through taxes  or through deposits hich is a better option is a point of debate hats not a point of debate is that we need to strengthen our financial institutions  keep them away from political influence  one way is privitizing them  and get more robust bankruptcy laws application  ecause it is pointless fear mongeringe had this discussion a few days ago hat do you think happens today if a ank fails and the government does not choose to bail it outou lose all your money above 1 lakh and go sue the ankhe ail n clause actually benefits you because youre going to be placed above bond interests because those onds will be used to recapitalize too  before coming after your depositshe matter of contention is that now the entity comes under scrutiny before actual failure  and that is a good thing y bone with it is why do we need a separate corporation instead of empowering the   but thats a different mattereriously  what do you think the laws are today o  if a bank has rising s people will move accounts to a safer bank hen the bank collapses on itself  from reducing accounts and rising s ecause baa baa black sheep have you any foolses sir yes sir one country full his is extremely scary anks give huge loans to the wealthy and influential hey default and to cover the banks losses  the depositers also take a hair cut or the money they forego  they are given equity in the bank which in most cases  will not be anywhere close to the extent of deposit used in bail in ame thing happened in yprus haiyya bail out aur bail in nahi  gau out or gau in amar dau dau bachiya hai uch saal baad gau ban jaayi ecause here is no provision of cancellation of eposits ail n exempts eposits and other liabilities while there is also provision of nsurance on every deposit account so your money remain safe ail n is the last resort to get you the money epositors and reditors apart from 100000 insurance money s usual media is peddling fake news odi will leave us only after sucking us off every penny we have   kuch chutiya admi hain bhai  arlier the insurance was 1 lakh  today its 0  not all that different in the larger scale  feel,8

mail  and  profile without your consent if any of your friends have them linked to your contact details  removed  raudsters get your personal details  easily available through hatspp ow o they hack hatsapp or whatsapp willingly just hand over user data which is bread and butter of   to any wannabe or reference  https  wwwefforg node 82654  work in a company which  has largest market share in banking software hese products assist banks to maintain security    financial rules like  and many other things work in  and big data maintenance along with cloud encryption o  let me tell you a thing or two on how this system worksirst of all  simply by knowing your phone number using whatsapp will not be sufficient to hack a bank ts like throwing a pebble on a lion at some kungfu nerve and hoping to kill it ts ridiculous so  will not even justify discussing this here because its not quora and assume people over here to just use their logic a little ow let us assume discussion is about hacking an individuals bank account  phishing is the most reliable way to do it ut be always aware to check if the website you have opened is https or not t is a very basic thing        hishing basically fools you to think that you are logging in to a bank but it is a private page of a hacker and you are basically texting him your password by typing over there ow any hacker can easily deceive google security by making a hash code which he can crack easily so you wouldnt be notified by google too that this page is a security risk hen there are other ways too s come on your phone and in more than a few cases  locked phones prompts the message on screen and  can be seen from that screen his wouldnt be hacking but more like theft his btw is the best and to my knowledge the only way to hack into your friends facebook account here are other ways too but phishing is the most common t is like a kings pawn opening with many varities of its own sually a hacker develops his own way to phish but in 99 of the cases that involves sending you a mail and you opening a link through it or using your intranet or  to deceive the routerndian banking system under attackhis headline though is not about individual attacks on users but about an attack on a bank itself ie injecting your malware in their servers to redirect you to phishing or anywhere from banks servers directly t is very much possible for high end hackers but they will be caught by the system easily ne of my companys software provide three layers of security after authentication which is almost impossible to break ther products provide microservices to enhance security over different modules anks hire other firms solely to enhance security and have their own departments to enhance it even more anks have multiple servers and their multiple back ups in multiple locations through which data traverse while your authentication happens o physically hacking a server may get you past first layer but not other layers ow using cyber attacks to go past all the servers is very very very tough ts like landing on moon tough ountries who have that capability can do that hen again  their are people with advanced brains and skills who dream of owning an island so theoretically they also might do it  ut a malware which redirects you to a different webpage through a banks server is also possible but would be detected in milliseconds uch a malware can remain in system to attack for that 1 millisecond for a few times but then again transactions are extremely hard to do even after knowing your passwords because banks detects  jumps  have  verification process  have card grids any many other ways to ensure transaction is done by you and not by someone else    ven if someone puts a malware in a bank which is extremely tough and that easily detectable  he might get an idea of your bank balance but he cant do transactions hese are mostly rumors to shake stock markets by targeting those nontechnical

is great but not sure if every other bank does it o add when this happened  a bank official told me this has been happening with many people of late so  think some fuck up has happened with our

be given to s who can invent ways to isolate people based on their unique identification hy are bills and laws being passed with vague terminology and wording he largest democracy in the world is proving to be the most retarded democracy in protecting its own people and their interests ven after such loopholes are discovered and exposed  the upreme ourt is just sitting on its ass and not doing anything to correct the flawed system f such an attitude is displayed by the highest authority of the country  why do we even respect the institution named upreme ourt o be more precise  what respect does the upreme ourt exhibit towards the common man  used to be one of the meh  why such a ruckus about adhars biometrics  but  must say  this shit is truly scary now rwellian seems to be the wordtuff like ris enabled tabs are still in their early stages and cost might be a factor  but a decade from now  a govt could do whatever it wants with thislso that rule about s is fucking silly ssume  get mugged  how in fuck am  supposed to remember my adhar card number etarded shit o we have ight to rivacy though rticle 21 says  o person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by lawny lawyers who can clear up please ost people here have not deciphered the governments game plan on adhar asically  it wants to side step and push until one can get it via underhanded tactics o  technically it might not be required but they will push it as they know courts have a high turn around time y then  they would have achieved their  objective  mass collection of  data  deleted  awesome writeup govt is trying their best to shove aadhar down our throats looks like soon im going to be deprived of basic amenities because i lack adhar card  proliferation in engal is not much still   did not want to make aadhar account ut then  was forced to because my new employer  an  based   made it mandatorys it legal for foreign based companies to ask for you aadhar card  am not able to wrap my head around this issue  so guys help me here please dentification   and others have given examples of adhaar being required for authentication and identification in various scenarios hings like    ttendance  kype calls with ovt  deliverance of government services and subsidies etc t the basic level we all know for a fact that identification is required for all these things ow why is adhar number  card  as a proof od identity and residence  worse than pancard  license  passport  rationcard  electricitybill  phonebill  bpl card  bank statement etc f just one single card identificationproof works for mostthings  where we need identification authentication  why is it bads it an issue with us being forced ike there is no compulsion to own have any of the identifications like pancard etc   mentioned above  but we are indirectly being pushed to have adhar cards ut there again for various stuff we have been forced to get these cards ike a pancard is not compulsory in theory but becomes so when you start earning r a passport  license  rationcard under different circumstances iometrics  t eases the authorization identification and reduces the chances of frauds and scams mobile banking transactions might actually become more secure with these isuse his is a concern which is very valid ut how and under what circumstances re we looking at real threats or just farfetched fictionethodologies adopted by the govt  s the  mentioned that the way adhar ill was passed and there is clause which can enable the govt to make changes arent really kocher owever  arent we mixing up the two things hats done and how it got done are two different subjects rong way does not make adhar itself wrong appy to change my opinion s there an  where  can donate which would fight against adhaar in upreme ourt  will not take adhaar unless the  says there is no way out  other purposes other technology safeguardso   bothered checking out section 23ubsection 1 puts execution of process of issue completely in the authoritys handslause  t  of subsection 2 goes like this  t  such other powers and functions as may be prescribedre you fucking kidding me o the existing govt can do whatever the hell it wants with  datall hell breaks loose if something open to interpretation like other creeps into contract or tender documents oo bad we dont subject legislative bills to same standards will resists getting this card as much as posible  lets see how long we can survive ets just wait till the database get hacked  as some selfimportant abu was too selfimportant and missed the deadline to submit two notorized copies of the form for updating the  and anti spyware on the servers for better protection  and the arliamentary ppropriations ubcommittee for oftware ervices to dhar and ther urposes doesnt retroactively allow any software updates until the next budget cycle  ow well is our database secured and who is privy to this information is the big question  uch a complicated situation f this was in the hands of a more unbiased government  like uh uh  d feel safer his + smart city initiative is really panning out to be an rwellian landscape  cant tell if its just the usual tech paranoia of things changing rapidly and people remaining as good bad as they already are  or the possibility of an intense dictatorshipood thing the ndian govt is shitty at execution dhaar  am aadmi ka adhikaar my ass he wild wild west days of technology are over t is slowly being institutionalized using adhaar and other means  this was a predictable step in the trend of adoption of modern tools for progress of the countryou may call it a trojan but  say this is the govts equivalent to a google facebook tracking cookie o serve the best interests of all participants  adhar needs to be omniscient and omnipresent  am glad that adhar is the defacto identification system f the ovt makes it the only number or identification required that would be even better                  rivacy is a boogeyman argument ome institution has to have a list of people who are ndians or living in ndia   which is obviously the government  f anyone wants to transact with the government or society needs to have an identification  hats the basic requirement   suppose it is free and doesnt require renewal or running around to get one           t is a good approach to prototype in small areas of government schemes before widening it further rovides opportunities for scaling and error corrections othing sneaky about it         t is entirely voluntary as well here is no forced drive to enrol anyone           nly issue with adhar is they could have made it into citizenship proof         lad to see there are technical progress into making adhar compatible tablets and mobiles           ery good initiative hy there is no  in the upreme ourt h  notagain the conspiracy theorists  luddites ook  lets get 2 things straight  which you probably would agree with too1  o improve efficiency  governance  it helps a lot if every citizen has a unique 2   system can be risk free  there will always be ways to break it he best the architects can do  is to make the breaches difficultow  if you agree with #1  then you need to accept #2 as acceptable riskf you disagree with #1  then you probably dont understand how egovernance works f you want to know what real constant surveillance is then open your oogle dashboard ocations  voice search  market targeting and now there is this ok oogle  the phone is constantly listening   bet  has a back door to everything  roviding dhar as a proof gives immediate results  try doing it for your next sim cardf not doing any illegal things  then why worry about privacy he data ending up in wrong hands is only valid worry  and is called a breach rctc having a breach turned out fake ure govt has a full proof contract with data management provider our freedom and your privacy is not because of lack of technology ts because we the people have decided to govern ourselves this way ou have more power than you realize and the government has less than you think top thinking of the ndian state as an rwellian entity t isnt and if it becomes  the blame can only be on us adhaar would have no hand in that,8

make the jargon clear to us hile bad on paper  the current scenario is actually better than expectedhe fact that banks have bad loans is an ancient fact of life  these loans extend to many many places  from large firms to small farmerst was always expected that some government  would have to intervene ecentually to fix this ts the  who has to handle it  and  fully expect them to handle it he issue itself is resolved by the bureaucrats and the bankers  with the o firmly in the driving seatut the issue is always the release of bank funds as largesse ts a mainstay of ndian politics  in one form or the other ne of the unspoken rules of the game so farhe divestiture of s  or stronger oversight capital norms as a means to constrain loans will help he clean up of banks will be a good thing  and it will allow for loan cycle to occur on the base of a healthy banking sector  which can handle any future negative shockonestly  this is business as expected ts good that people are upset  but being upset wont make a difference since this is essentially a cyclical feature of the larger economy and our banking private networkules which are followed  divestment  distance between center politics and  management are the cure  and theyve been the cure since the reform process started  but havent been completed  can add few points on he anks y ad is a hief anager of a ublic ector ank in a unicipal own based in ranch anagers hief anagers dont like having s on their books either he problem stems from the onal evel he onal anager assigns quarterly yearly loan targets to individual branches pplications for larger  and possibly good  loans that are forwarded to the zonal managers sit on their desks for several weeks  the borrower usually moves on to a rivate ank ow all thats left is smaller loan applications from shaky applicants  local politicians who wants to build schools engineering colleges  and activists who would threaten to rite to the   his happened a lot during the  era   he onal anagement  despite being sloppy  still expects the ranch anagers to meet the targets o s give the loan and hope it would not become a  before they get transferred  so that the live bomb is passed on to the new guyith a bit of negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management  you can avoid declaring few loans as  for a bunch of quarters h  and  dont even want to speak about the crazy ones that retire as ranch anagers hey go on a loaning spree hanks a lot his is some major issue which no one seems to care about in media  have been telling this to friends and family and actually no one really cares hat concerns me is the part where they might bail out these richass people with public money hat will be unjust hese people have the means to pay back and yet they take advantage of out easy recovery normsrony is banks wouldnt writeoff agricultural or small loans as these people are easier to bully and that will result in farmer suicidesut they are happy to go with all the loss because somewhere we have lenient norms and these wigwigs are the ones who control our economic policiesdit  he indu ditorial on this issue  http  wwwthehinducom opinion oped nobailoutwithtaxpayermoney article8241268ece  oans being written off from the books or provisions being kept against bad debt doesnt mean that there wont be recovery he whole aghuram ajan point in the opening post doesnt make sense hat would be like blaming a government which enforces accurate reporting of crimes for increase in crime statisticshe lowly bank managers have little say in large loans he decision for the biggest s are taken at least at eneral anager level  some even at hairman level  ne needs to investigate these bad loans  seize the assets of willful defaulters and charge the real decisionmakers in bankhe whole issue is that of bankers being browbeaten to give risky debt to industrialists with political connections and the said industrialists refusing to pay up because they know that they have the connections and the power to avoid being hit by any action taken by common bank bankers  different ones from those who gave them loans  reat writeup hanks     question ig corporates  say ijay allya  take huge loans and then are not able to pay back and thus the write off hat does the law do here ant it catch the culprits and send them to jail r probably auction the properties that were kept as a guarantee while taking loan  havent heard of a bigshot  except ahara  who is sent to ail for not paying back the money  ijay allaya is a free man and they fucked up my credit score because i missed one payment on my education loans yenna rascals i tell ya   n top of it  ijay allya just resigned from nited pirits and got a payout of 515 millions515cr not million edantic but couldnt resist because of my intermittent  sorry ow can they ask the banks to waive off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of how the big defaulters arehe anks know who are the borrowers and  does not  so this is not an issue econdly  the loans are not being waived  as in cancelled or forgiven forgotten  hats a wrong and dangerous word to use in this context he loans are being written off hat that means is  as you say earlier in you post  that once the borrower has failed to service the loan  willingly or due to the things he cant control  the banks writeoff  called provisioning  could be partial or full  that in their  and alance heet to show the true reflection of their own health  ajan is pushing for aggressive approach  as you mention later in the post  hat does not mean that the borrower walks away he anks continue to make efforts to recover the money  through notices  publicshaming  selling assets of borrower  change of management  restructuring  conversion into equity  courtcases  sale of loan to s etc  f a loan  or part of that  has been written off by the bank  and the bank manages to recover it  the amount is written back and becomes a profit for that year n interesting example here would be the business cycle of mid 90searly 2000s t that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually in a worse shape than today ut fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most of the bank clients turned around and anks averted a disaster ost borrowers were commodity companies at that time  steel  cement etc  his time this is not likely to happen o the mess wouldnt clear itself up  hey could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money ot only did they not take these measures they actually forced the anks to lend to their favored borrowers one of the biggest defaulter is nitech  which people say is a andhifamily company  rumor  dont ask for source   group another big defaulter was close to   indals to ongress   to awar   to uda adra and so on  hey will benefit immensely from this loan writeoff and bailoutsf the government banks play by the book  which is a big ask  they need not eize their fucking assets f they have given a personal guarantee  seize their homes too  o what happens nexthort term overnment puts equity into the banks and they somehow surviveedium term opefully this overnment puts professional management into the top layers of the bank  oard and   and the rot is contained t is happening in ank f aroda but again a tall askong term he relative size of the  bank will shrink  pvt banks will become bigger ne last point hy are politicians reluctant in reforming or privatizing the anks ecause that is the biggest tool of granting favors to corporates who in turn are the biggest political donors he last last point here is a ilver lining  he banks problem is a stockproblem ie the loans already given are going bad and we need to deal with it hat the system does not have  fortunately  is the flow problem ie new money is coming into the system and if the investment cycle picks up  we will have the money to fund it  elevant ocumentary  verdose he ext inancial risis  https  wwwyoutubecom watchv4i6pbz  t is really appreciated that we have people like you who are willing to be frank about such situations ingfisher irlines borrowed an amount of s 7000 crore from 17 banks hese loans were declared as  and the recoverable amount has come to a mere s 6 crore o figure how much will be recovered from the 44 lakh crorehe reason why this happened is because allaya used the trademarks and labels of kingfisher as collateral with the banks ut the value of these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt ow this goes without saying that a brand name would lose its value if it goes bankrupt  so why did banks took the risk of taking kingfisher trademarks as collateral in the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporationhe bench headed by hief ustice asked t is all there in this ndian xpress reportell  thats stranges supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from a newspapers report  always post this lecture article by ajan on the topic of attitude of borrowers towards the bank wwwoutlookindiacom article weneedachangeinmindset 292696 he average interest rate on loans to the power sector today is 137 even while the policy rate is 8 he difference  also known as the credit risk premium  of 57 is largely compensation banks demand for the risk of default and nonpayment ince the unscrupulous promoter hides among the scrupulous ones  every businessperson is tainted by the bad eggs in the basket ven comparing the rate on the power sector loan with the average rate available on the home loan of 107  it is obvious that even good power sector firms are paying much more than the average household because of bank worries about whether they will recover loans eforms that lower this 300 basis point risk premium of power sector loans visavis home loans would have large beneficial effects on the cost of finance  perhaps as much or more than any monetary policy accommodationlso

kumbhakaran you may want to add these links if you find them useful insightful hrough some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft  the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans hey didnt have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in ntil ajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loanst is not possible for the manger to hide bad loans as periodical review of all the accounts is done any of the bad loans have till now been prevented from being classified as s by refinancing them with short term loans to avoid defaults he  has now asked them to classify even such loans as bad loans lso under consortium lending even if one member bank recognizes an account as   all the banks are now required to treat the account as  which was not the case earlier oth of these are major causes for the higher  numberst is the top management which is responsible for the current mess and not just the front end manager who in most of the cases is just following orders from the top two very improtant numbers are missing 1   when you say 44 lakh cores in on erforming ssets  s what is the total out standing loan amounts outstanding for all banks concernedonly then can we say what percentage of total loans are si can see that 44 lakh cores seems like lot but it will not make any sense until we see what how much of the total loaned out amount are s2  also what are the total deposits help for all bank concernedwhen these two numbers are understood then this issue wont be as dire as it seemsall banks world over has sits the

a very intelligent writing  but surprised to link ingfisher irline loss to ijay allya f he did some thing illegal like diverting funds from ingfisher airlines to his personal accounts those kinds of activities are illegal and banks should go after his personal money s a corporation setup he might have invested some of his money in it and some other individuals or corporation who got shares of the

324,ello op inds of  india  s the ndian economy being nokiaed https  wwwredditcom r india comments cz0ctb hello top minds of rindia is the indian economy   ne of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption t was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy ow with rural consumption taking a hit  the government is clueless o revive demand it needs to pump that  surplus as development expenditure  but it risks increasing the inflation ith lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disasterong story short  the government is walking on fire hy not both heir cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown  but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer ir ndia etc to dani et al for cheaplso privatization does not have to be the governments brain child t could simply be the governments friends seeing an opportunity and them convincing the government  orce a fire sale of ndian government assetshis is a good rationale actually eep the tinfoil hat  well see more patterns like this  am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to okia nviting the top minds of r ndia 246000 replies coming up 1  lobal recession was long forecasted for 2020 2  e failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from hina 3  ndian economy rested on what we call black money   addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it  lack of government trust  and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who wont invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy ont forget recession is part of economy cycle robable future e should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses ossible but unlikely ovt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation  now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked   but  dont see it increasing borrowings ew minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to imbabwe root t will happen here are a lot of s that the govt wants to rid of  but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump ts hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one  its not just ndia but globally the investment is slowing here are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry theres a different reason hat  believe is that ndia in actuality never recovered well from 2008  while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 200912 from various public private sector banksill 2013 coupled with igh rude oil prices economy loomed  around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of s started kicking in economy uring the same time many big loans started converted to s and the every single month the s ballooned n between the entral overnments implementation of  and emonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption  as a lot of it depended on lack money   his is my personal opinion    he current government failed to control the s till 1 19 when there was reduction of stocks of s  by s21 000 r he government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them  although merging shouldnt have been a priority  while it wasnt a bad step per say he surplus that overnment skimmed from  a part of it might be used for  ecapitalisation which seems to be a good step  again its hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehendich will always get richer  theres no problem in that  believe the important issue is for the countries large population   ndia    is to deliver jobs and grow middle class ith a lot of manufacturing automation   automation it would be hard to grow a middle class   again this is an assumption    t this stage its very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market ow coming to selling assets   may be or may be not heres no singular answer  think governments montenisation plans on noncore assets is fine  if some business   riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of ndian bureaucracy its still not a bad deal   not atleast for an average tax paying ndian middle class citizen   we wont have to shell out money for operations of various s that are a burden on our pockets he biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultrarich here is a very little concern for middle class  anyhow this is nothing new e need to stop relying on entral   tate governments  as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business   like hina does     a lot of our business have to grow lobal ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on ndian domestic market  dont think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through  with questionable hiring process and oliticians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market hile its an extremely painstaking process but  do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in ndia   from mobile transceivers   to ustom s   who are actually making a lot of money eaving aside fancy       essentially decorated statisticians     here are huge opportunities in global markets  only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude ur economy is not just and shouldnt solely depend on a immature overnment

326,hat do you think that a united ndia would have looked like in terms of development  the economy  foreign policy  et cetera https  wwwredditcom r india comments cezrj9 what do you think that a united india would have   n undivided ndia wouldve been a disaster which would have made ndians pine for the rule of the ritish he compromises that the ongress and the uslim league would have had to make to avoid partition wouldve led to an extremely weak centre and immensely strong regional provinces  this wouldve quickly led to the creation of communal blocs in ndia with the uslim provinces of ashmir  sind  eastern engal  unjab  barely uslim majority though   facing off against the indu provinces elsewherehere would have been competitive communalism to an extent that you cant even imagine he uslim league during ritish times often petitioned them to declare ind and  as new provinces because they desired numerical parity with the indu dominated provinces of present day ndia like ombay  adras   etc his was because they wanted to engage in a balance of power type of situation where if a  state passes a law banning say  cow slaughter then  will pass a law banning public celebration of iwali his communalist tit for tat wouldve only strengthened communal forces and led quickly to a civil war situation only in this case the violence wouldnt have been confined to the border provinces of unjab and engal but wouldve engulfed the whole territory of the sub continent here would be riots in indh and in retaliation there would be riots in erala n foreign policy terms ndia would have a restive uslim population in akistan which would look for third party support from fellow uslim nations of ran and fghanistan his would be especially potent because there are vast historical and cultural links between the border territories with ashtuns in the case of akistan and alochis in the case of ran  crudely the ndus river actually is the real dividing line between ndian people and iranic people he ndian state would have similarly onerous defence requirements as it does now with the akistani border except it would also have to deal with a local population whose loyalty would always be suspect akistan has tried to pre empt ashtun nationalism by raising up the aliban to supplant it with slamic radicalisation  an option not available to a on slamic ndian state ndia would also be much more vulnerable to the mess in entral sia and the middle ast  both of the cold war  like ran and fghanistan  as well as the recent rise of sis type slamic extremism his has nearly destroyed the akistani state but the borders between the two countries has shielded ndia from the worst of it he unjabi uslim  according to mbedkar  was always the most susceptible to ideas of uslim brotherhood with the ability of radicals to weaponise this  like with the ujahideen  f these people were in the ndian state then it is more than plausible that they would still be as radicalized as they are now  except now as citizens of ndia they would have free reign to carry out attacks throughout the country instead of being largely confined to akistan n terms of economy  mbedkar in his thoughts on partition showcased that the provinces of present day akistan were mostly a drag on the ritish exchequer while the ndian provinces were a tax surplus his isnt necessarily true for all times but if you factor in the communal hatred that would develop between indu provinces and uslim provinces then  struggle to see a situation where the economic gains would be great armony is usually better for the economy than conflicthe situation of minorities of all types wouldve been worse ndian non muslims dont really care about the situation of their co religionists in akistan or angladesh his is pretty much true for akistani and angladeshi uslims as well with one huge exception being the abri masjid demolition which kicked off riots in angladesh and akistan aimed at indus there  destroying temples and killing people etc his wouldnt be the case in an undivided ndia  indu minorities in uslim provinces would be hostages ensuring the safety and well being of uslim minorities in indu provinces his was an idea mooted solely by the uslim league but m pretty sure that once there had been a tit for tat riot then the indu communalists wouldnt be far behind in adopting this theory eedless to say  not a good way to run a countryeople often say that ndia is secular only because it is 80 indu and  agree with that statement not because of any great rationality in the indu faith  but because the question of religious hegemony in ndia is settled he proportion of muslim in undivided ndia wouldve been large enough for the indus to start feeling threatened and for the uslims to start demanding their pound of flesh  and maybe a bit more  he insecurity is highest at such a point where theres a chance of hegemonic change  it couldve been a domestic variant of hucydides rap leading to civil war and eventual fragmentation of the country ar better for one religious group to be in the outright  unchallengeable majority and to feel secure enough by this to give rights to the minority religions is thank you innah ndia is not united right now,9

contributions here already here is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though  public sector jobs  especially police  judiciary and healthcare workers his is important  firstly  because most of our public services are so understaffed here is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance  scant police coverage in most areas  absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country n efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity  healthier  safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy econdly  having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs  especially in the service economy he problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing his is a big problem  believe fully staffing our public services is an investment e dont question the need for physical infrastructure  we shouldnt for well staffed public services lso  its high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the

thread ll try to divide my reply in two parts he first where  reply to some of your points and the second where ll try to write up some new parts which you didnt touch on                                                          irst part low but teady estern conomies ccelerated rowth ast siahis is actually somewhat inaccurate s ani odrik and many others have pointed out  there has only been one single path to prosperity for large economies which cant rely on fossil fuels or on tourism like rinidad and obago  hats the path of exportled manufacturing growth ost people mistakenly think this is the ast sian model but this was how the   ermany and rance all developed ame is true with the  anufacturing was a huge part of the  economy up until perhaps the 1970s ome people claim ndia cant replicate this model for two reasons he first is automation   which limits employment opportunity he second is slow trade protectionism ll be brief on boths far as  utomation is concerned  a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs ts just that they were in the factory back in the old days oday everything is hyperspecialised  so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are socalled auxiliary services hey dont get counted with manufacturing today  but they should f they were  job losses arent nearly as bad as its made out to bes for trade protectionism is concerned  its true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times  but historical perspective is needed he average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now orea  aiwan and the other sian tigers as well as reland and some astern uropean nations oland  lovakia etc  had very rapid growth during this period  despite generally low global growth o   think this excuse doesnt really hold today es  the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s  but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average  adly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports t best fabrics and some niches like home textiles e havent been able to crack the apparels segmentur largest textile companies  measured in terms of investment or market cap  are yarn companies or home fabrics companies n footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear  but this beef ban thing could be a detterant   u ringtring your original post is good but  would like to point that hailand   angladesh   alaysia and ndonesia are not under ast sia but under  ew points   here estern dvanced economies like the    undertook economic development in tandem with political development hey did not begin with universal franchise emantic use of the term in tandem is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless  sing such broad terms one can even say that outh orea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed  he fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the est like  esp was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it  where basically no one exists  eaning  no one has ever developed under a democracy nd since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided hings like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric ndia is an older proper democracy than  in this manner   other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights  s for the point on why ndia has underperformed  he fundamental reasons are that ndia has not followed the general path that leads to development here is no niversal model for it but there are certain practices which are nearuniversal meaning they are de facto prerequisite requirements  hings like having an nfrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like ervices and   his a a dynamic which goes even beyond ndustrialization here is no development and stability without nfra development oads were the first things a new empire build  hen at the same time as this is and reforms  its another prerequisite here are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century  verything else comes afterwards ndia is accumulating factors which are exceptional  things like emocracy from the get go  ertiary sector before nfrastructure and reform not even done barring few places like erala  ts no wonder things wouldnt be smooth sailing nd about hat ndia needs   am of a different view ndia should help where the people are and they are in the rimary sector  they are farmers hat is where the labor force is elp them and you solve multiple problems roblems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool roblems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete  exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit  roblems like uprooting people in a country like ndia which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues  elping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck t helps bring the  levels up  it helps the social security dynamic t helps in the balanced development of all majority people argument   urrently though there is no proper model for it nd this is where my views are different than most ndia is already doing things in its own way t is already the exception t should look for new models of growth instead of relying on preexiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage ndia is in o model is universal  they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in ndia should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation   urrently though ndia seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is apid rowth through fast tracked rbanization 10 years back ndian urbanization rate was less than 20  now its reaching mid 30s  o me this goes against the ndia ethos and even practically its not sound for ndia given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources   hen oreans hinese started to make toys to be sold in the west  they never knew they would become some one like this ndian ways of growing is not faulty  it can be considered as a new way e have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and hina orea  gave a lot of importance during early industrializationndustrialization needs infrastructure  skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in ndia e have a pathetic infrastructure ecause the government doesnt want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building  we could not build everything very quickly oads ridges orts ailways are very slow and inefficient ost people will not leave land easily he environment must be protected he contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality ural education is in a very bad condition ost factory workers  construction crew usually come from rural areas n ndia  most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained nefficient governance is also another reason ur state is very backward t takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies ureaucrats usually dont work for people unless someone attacks them aw enforcement is also very bad  his post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold ve been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion hanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion  eading it has been a pleasure ts disheartening that the comments dont have as many points and the ones in the political threads do  ne area prime for reforms and job creation  feel is agriculture  think ndia is employing a huge proportion of its population in farming and yet its very inefficient  maybe the latter is the cause for former  think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation  warehouses and storage  distribution and transportation and food processing his coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semiurban areas be it teachers public

he would have been remembered well hastri  7 10  it of a surprise package uring his early days in office  hed kept a pretty low profile  almost like lateterm  ut he rose to the occasion in 1965  when

nationalization drive  consummating ndias flirtation with socialism started by her dad  and her overt political dealings     dont think her political machinations were any worse than the others  she just carried them out more openly  and broadened her scope of influence  opening the door to other politicians doing the same  he also handled the halistan situation badly  p lue tar well  that was a crying shame n the flip side  she was the most decisive  ndia has had  she knew when to get out of the way and let the professionals do their job ndias profile rose with the sian games   and other

338,   hy are young educated ndians overwhelmingly in favor of right wing economic policies compared to the rest of the developed world  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 250xy2 r why are young educated indians overwhelmingly   ecause unlike the occupy hipsters in the est  weve lived through welfare socialism and have seen the effects of economic liberalization m socially on the left wing  but right wing when it comes to economics m totally for a free market economy  wish ndia would adopt the  ordic model  http  enwikipediaorg wiki ordic model   nstead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like estern urope or candinavia  why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy orry but your understanding of economics seems to be flawed ndia is a mixed economy  tate and rivate sector are involved in production and it is not a free market economy  but a heavily regulated economy in which the state intervenes to correct the natural equilibrium of demand  supplyhe model you are referring to is the ordic model  ocial arket conomy to use the technical term  n this the type of set up there is actually more free market than the crony free market of the  or other free market economies ordic model is one that is capitalistic but tempered by an implementation of rdoliberalism which says markets are free  competition decides if companies thrive or fall  there will be regulation to ensure fair competitionwhy do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ho wants to move to a free market corpotocracy hat  and  generalise  a lot of young ndians want is labour law reforms  more transparent rule making while reducing discretionary nonsense that is the cornerstone of ndian bureaucracy right now  support for infrastructure and consequently letting the private sector do what it does best ake money  create goods  services while creating jobs obody says that we shouldnt invest tax money in poverty alleiviation programs or investing in infrastructure or run schools  hospitals or any such thing hat we want is an end to the aaiaap sarkaari model that the gress has imposed upon this nation for 50 years  model in which the government uses handouts to control votes  while keeping the nation poor and dependant on the government for their daily bread  butterhy do we want leaders like arendra odi to be like onald egan or itler  ouldnt ranklin  oosevelt be a better role model   took merica out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in merican historyhis is the second time  am seeing your admiration for  and not questioning that  but what do you understand of his policiesave you truly looked at odis economic philosophies ill ujliwala said crony capitalism  nobody ever accused odi   uj of crony capitalism nyways  back to the topic on hand s key solutions to recovery were as follows  ecovery of the griculture sector reate jobs at stable wages  in reality though  wages dipped while the number of jobs created increasedcheck wages paid out via the  if you need clarity on this  sing a fiscal deficit  atleast in the 1st  2nd ew eals  to fund the  to create infrastructure ncreased corporate taxation  it is another matter that this was absolutely watered down here are other iscal policies   onetary policies which  will not discuss now as it is not relevant to the point  am trying to make belowook at odis ujarat minus whatever blinkers you might have he only state to have grown its rimary  agriculture  sector at 10 plus  while the rest of the country grew at roughly 2 hile critics point out to other advanced states like aha or  and compare  growth rates  keep in mind the growth patterns of these states is   hey have moved directly from a primary economy to a tertiary economy skipping entirely the manufacturing phase which is where jobs are created s a net share  anufacturing+griculture contribute roughly 60 of the states   while in states like aha and  this would be at a paltry 35 eep in mind  nationally gri+anufacturing account for close to 70 of all employment tate with the  unemployment figures  he above thrust on the primary  secondary are paying off obs are being created ave real wages dipped yes  but that is more of a function of demand  supply equilibirum and less of vil dani pays less hurr durr  axation in uj  despite all accusations of crony capitalism aside  has increased  it has the highest contribution of tax revenue as a percentage of total revenue is at 80 which is the highest in the country learly  all that free land is paying off in the form of increased state taxesow does any of the above equate to crony capitalism hy would a crony capitalist develop the primary sectory where 60 of our population works f anything  thrust on the agricultural sector+increased job creation+increased taxation were aside from the fiscal tweakings a corner stone of s ew ealruly you seem to be spouting the same gibberish less informed people spout  you might want to look at the macro economic indicators before you come to any conclusionsot every haddi wearing anghi is a brain dead communalist  some of us have decided to vote for him more because of his economic policies and not for whatever else people vote for him think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like ussia or any of the outh merican countries hy do people want to move from one corrupt system to another eally imply take a list of the big name s and ndian manufacturing powerhouses operating out of uj and dani   mbani would be just one amongst the ords  amsungs  eugeots  enaults  akshmi teels  ahindras  atas etc etc t is sad that off all the bad things ujliwala has done  he has used his goodwill in convincing people that odis gujarat supports crony capitalism ot much original thought in this ssentially your entire question  they are doing  why arent weutside of sources like ox news  western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism  especially after the global financial crisis of 20078 he same general idea is reflected in the educated youth college grads in the developed world tooeither the media  nor the students  are contributing to their nations growthhy does ndia have the complete opposite attitude towards economics ecause its required he kids joining nternational ocialist rganization live in first world countries that can afford unemployment benefitsnstead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like estern urope or candinavia  why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ecause we have the largest number of extremely poor people e need to make money to feed themhy do we want leaders like arendra odi to be like onald egan or itler  ouldnt ranklin  oosevelt be a better role model   took merica out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in merican historyonald eagan was one mans comparison n any case  all merican presidents have sworn by free enterprise  its only their socialism that has varied in degrees odi is prowelfare too  just not a welfare state to the exclusion or detriment of private enterprises it just an overextension after years of misrule under the ongress party   dont want to believe that ndians are inherently more selfish than everybody elseelfish is a good thing e want to make money e want to pay taxes e want the poor to be helped  but dont hold us back from our own destinies think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like ussia or any of the outh merican countries hy do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ersonally  doubt there will be any major change in economic or foreign policy no matter who comes to power  but the mentality of ndias urban educated youth is interestingeh our pov is too popular and stopped being relevant after the  crisisndia has no option f not odi  then someone from the economic right  believe it is mostly due to a false sense of entitlement and upbringing  he fact that you have had a decent life and have never had to live through abject poverty leads to apathy towards the underprivileged o you tend to root for policies that will benefit your current standing  which in case of educated young ndians are the right wing policies ecause merica and the west have strayed in too much to the right e have strayed on too much to the left oure comparing two different things n the political scale   am a leftsocial libertarian conomically   am liberal but to an extent  believe in laissezfaire capitalism but with government oversight and regulation to prevent monopolies  pollution  and gouging customers ssentially  rules that would apply to an individual to ensure the harmonious functioning of society  should apply to a corporation as wellow if the economic climate is way to the right of me   would look like  am on the left of the spectrum n an economic climate that is way to the left of me   would look like  am on the right of the spectrumhe first case applies to the   have been here since 99  think the economic policies are pretty much braindead and have gone too far to the right ntense deregulation is what led to the financial crisis of 08 orporations have way too much power  and you essentially have statesanctioned monopoly ensured by the revolving door between corporations and ashington  current head of  used to work for omcast for example  n ndia  you have the other extreme arleft policies and the disastrous experimentation with abian socialism have stunted the economy and slowed down development he ndian economy is comparatively hostile to entrepreneurship  although the situation is way better than it was  say 20 years ago n fact  it was a combination of ehrus and ndiras policies that brought ndia to the brink of bankruptcy in 89 90  and it was only because of liberalization at that point that ndias economy was saved he additional liberalization during the  years also helpedo this  in short  is why  favor regulation in the   but deregulation in ndia hat ndia needs to do is learn from the mistakes the  made and not go too far in that direction ecause ndia is too far to the left economically relative to the  ou cant equate the current right wing of  with anything ccording to their principles even their past governments would have been considered liberal

345,our thoughts on esports https  wwwredditcom r india comments bwkqxu your thoughts on esports   he main reason that esports hasnt flourished in ndia yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who dont play games are not educated about the potential of esports and its success in other countries arents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real jobecond reason is that we ndians dont spend a lot of money  especially on luxury goods  and good s are luxury ence parents dont feel like its worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatilef we want esports to grow in ndia  we need to educate people about it t was difficult in merica itself to accept esports as a profession listened to a really good podcast episode between he sports bserver and kshat athee from  aming where kshat explains the esports scene in ndia and also explains why people cheat ts a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in ndia eres the link https  openspotifycom episode 28f8f8tlwqvqn15si1ciuaqm4 ill only get bigger ts inevitable anish  playing with stralis  considered best  team ever  was just a  move around their election time hat being said  a number of toptier talents come from ordic and candinavian regionhat being said  a career in esports is still not viable even outside  let alone here f youre not a talent in a top org  bills become hard to pay here have been many instances where talented people  teams had to raise funds from the community itself  dont know about other games  but ndian  pros dont have the talent like the  players hey are just way better  just ownslso to make big bucks  we ll have to invest time and money specially sports lso doing it unless you are absolutely sure nvesting thousands of hours practicing o you think the society will accept it hey ll just brand the guy addicted to gaming  gaming is bad  it should be banned rosspost to r indiangaming as well e need a break out star in a competitive game like faker or sumail  so we can kick start more poeple in our country e have teams but they are just so far behind international standards ut hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade n my local area  a lot of gaming pubs host  and  tournamentsut  believe its gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here nless people take gaming seriously nothings gonna happen alf of my friends didnt knew  was a thing unless it hit the play store  feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise  gaming   y friends tease me for playing games on  saying  have no life and shit and yet they play  the whole day  sports wont be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the ndian society ur aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only  hope someone revives itn the few years ve seen some really great ndian born games on mobile gaming platform heyre not 10 10 but at least theyre of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpartecently our college was creating clubs  wanted to make an sports club badly but  realized 90 of my colleagues wouldnt know its meaning he idea got buried ven if  did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties  want an sports club and explain them   m pretty sure theyd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day he general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like ota  to flourishe might have more players than urope but the skill level is terrible  dont thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports ts not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill ive it another 10 years and it will become an lympic port irst of all  let  edeye talk some sense into you ts esports  https  wwwyoutubecom watchvb8a o  m a fellow competitive csgo follower   stralis era btw  ajority of ndia has no concept of esports  think we need to convince a certain influential ujarati man to educate our masses about esports  because  see no other way of esports growth in ndia ot in the near future at least eople dont considered gaming streaming an occupation here  bet most of the people dont know about joining esport orgs or e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn gamesxcluding cheap and free games like  ota 2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question pc parts cost 2x more in ndia and people dont think its good investment he reason why esports havent taken off in ndia is that we dont have any fallback options here are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by ndian society and in extent ndian firms ets say  you try your hands on esports  you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it hen you need to get a job and thats only backed up by education o firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv ot to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports  theres a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewerhe same is applicable for other type of sports ootball is very popular in est engal  but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet f youve watched angal then youd know what happens to mir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general he only two ways to make an honest living in ndia is either through education or through business sports wont help you in either in the long run ont you remember the  referencing pubg  feel that esports is pernicious for the society in general t promotes an unhealthy lifestyle laying videogames for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on ones health  both physical and mental ven though  love playing video games  ports for me is still something physical ports re they still calling them sports to make them feel and sound more legit ol,10

as gifted as achin  he more than makes up for that through elite level of fitness that allows him to run doubles after scoring a hundred at same speed when he came on the crease e plays cricket for

evident by the way he has carried himself in the public eye  most remarkably when he defended his thengirlfriend  and now wife  nushka harma when she was getting trolled by his supporters t is important to note that he started his career at an early age and since then  he has been under scrutiny ll of us were dumb as teenagers  just that our antics were not scrutinized by the media f anything  irat ohli should be a role model for all young boys e lost his father when he was barely in his teens  went to play a match while grieving his death  led his team to victory  made the team  became the best damn player that ndia has seen in a long time and is now leading the team to victory in the  hat too  without any connections or influence  purely on the basis of his talent and hard work e also seems to be popular with his team and has their respect and support e is a supportive husband who is not afraid to show his love for his wife and to stand up for her is aggression is a part of his game and it is what makes him  him  dont think thats a valid reason to hate on him  given that the aggression has never transformed into anger issues giving way to physical violence e is a shining example of how your talent and hard work can take you to dizzying heights s far as pure skill and temperament goes he is in his own league e is better than sachin  dont think es overrated  e deserves to run his mouth and act like douche all he wants if he can back it up ou dont have to love his personality  just his cricket akes it all the more fun and satisfying to watch him be cocky and then get outplayed and humbled by the other team every once in a while  loved old virat exactly for his hot headed behaviorn this country woth all our bullshit like repect elder  respect the tradition  act mature bla bla bla he was such a nice changee used to have fuck you i have skills back up my attitude mentality which was so fucking inspirational ndia needed young energy like him which showed that skill and hard work are the most important not sucking to people above youow he has matured though which is also goodn a healthy society hard working successful people should be  celebrated and respectedvirat is beast when it comes to hardwork e is a great player which is what matters m a big big ohli fan es a run machine robably the best white ball batsman ever ever ever seen someone so consistent as him he only thing that keeps him going is his ferocious intensity n field he might be a nightmare for opposition  but off the field  he does come across as a very cool guy ave seen almost all of his interviews and found none where he acted as a dick veryone has their own strengths that gets the best of out them honis calmness maybe  but for irat  its his agression and intensity s arsha hogle said it  you take intensity out of ohli  theres no ohli left tw  honi isnt cool calm aina had pointed it out during one interview that honi frequently gives a stick  which is not wrong  bused anish on camera   again  nothing wrong  and latest where he came on field to confront the umpire for the noball call  realized it a long time ago  before he was crowned a legendary status ou woke up pretty late  have never seen a biggest snob in the sports before ohli verrated o motherfucker hes not oull understand when you start watching cricket  dont know why ndian fans are so obsessed with behaviour  cousin who lives in ustralia told me how many fans he has there   understand the sport oull know hes already a legend nd hes better than honi dk why honi has more fans than achin and ravid honi cant perform outside ndia es overrated eah   know this comment will be downvoted to oblivion o shit eople are generally pretty obnoxious when it comes to ero worship  and the cricket fans take it to the next level  support this opinion e is absolutely loved by media o questions are asked about his captaincy  decisions etc just let off he is role model for young and aspiring players    ssholes will always be assholes hy not be a good cricketer while youre at it    hate cricket gree,10

channels running on 2  now m paying 300+  no sports channels  other  channels cut in halfcrew you 2  has always been a loser when it came to the public hey were not able to reduce the call drops hey totally screwed us during net neutrality until  due to immense public pressure  they decided to go with it nd now this ts time  is held accountable for its existence   anticipates that channel prices will come down graduallyut d say get a firestick   a decent broadband connection and subscription of those streaming apps  switched and never lookd back to    am an ndian who stays in bangalore who watches content from almost all the channels  kannada  tamil  telugu  hindi  english  and  have to pay almost around 800 ish if  want to have the same experience o fuck me right  eal dick move by  his pricing scheme is helpful only for people who watched very few channels to begin with  had put a cap on discount that operators could provide in bouquets 15 max discount on bouquet than alacarte hat would have gotten the price of individual channels down ll operators went to adras igh ourt against this rule where  ruled against  ith much lower prices for bouquets than alacarte  operators are basically forcing you to take their bouquets instead of going alacarte way  s of now   has withdrawn 15 discount cap petition from upreme ourt  ame herey yearly subscription will end soon  have already subscribed to ony iv and ee5 ill subscribe to otstar soon and too voot when they will have live channel available  they dont have subscription model as of today  t will cost me around  3000  per year  have got 150gb broadband connection which is never utilized o ll be getting all the channels for 250 per month and since  have multiple   the average will be much less  thank  for screwing up this well  think  was way too comfortable with what  had hey made me rethink the entire cabel cost optimization emoved sony channels ot ony liv yearly subscription    used to pay 280 for all the channels  now  have to pay 600 for the channels which me and my parents watch o to hell   ine went from 280 to 200  deleted   used to pay 600ish monthly ow its half that hank you    guess ost reduced for them who only watched epublic  ine went down from 300 to 275 watch only  and dont have any hindi s  think those channels are really expensive and pack costs have gone up for those watching hindi s for rest there is definitely a declinelso those who watch a limited number of channels have benefited while those who watch a large set have been fucked  are absolute dickheads e should also blame the government for letting this happen  bh the problem isnt with    its the nature of  and cable market which is against any good reform in the sector y bumping up each channel rates to such an high price they say either toe the bouquet way or opt the alacarte model at your peril  hope in coming days they reform the cost of hannels to the optimum cost m on the other side of the coin y monthly cost came down because  barely watch   just picked the packs for channels my mom watches and  was done  just add the sports channels on the days when there are matches  want to watch and remove them the next day  hanks  ust like  made everything cheaper  his is what im getting for s335 in atasky  tar sports 1    tar sports elect 1  2    en 1 and 2   un v        tar ijay    dithya    hats it idiculous  our costs will be lower when you stop watching   xoxo    was paying 550 + 250 for a long duration pack ow paying 300 + 250  multi   arlier you were probably being subsidised by those users watching fewer channels paying more than what they actually needed ime to pay your fair shareooking at the pricing on   website  https  channeltraigovin    most of the channels cost 7 or less f those you mentioned  ony  ony sports channels and olors cost 19  and even these are available in bouquets to lower costs   dont see how you can be mad at  when theyre instituting a per channel pricing and making it transparent  dont understand how can anyone enjoy all the stupid bullshit they show on ndian tv n recent years ndian influences have destroyed the only good channels worth watching like           etc nyone intelligent in their right mind would cut the cable and use internet to watch anything entertaining  had to keep the connection just for my parents and they too dont watch serials and all the vomit inducing reality shows o this new system is pretty great for me  just chose very few channels that we actually flip through only 300 rs  ry getting packs only watch sports  football  and  got a pack that was cheaper than selecting one by one  use the trai website to see cheapest plan  think those who watch more channels should be given some discount   pay  250 for cable  and have almost channelsxcept some sports channels ecause they are expensiveow we will have to pay shit loads ame here  used to pay 400 for all  and  channels ow  am getting only sony sports pack and star value pack am actually shocked am just waiting for iga fiber and giga tv  xactlyad to forego the  channels in order to get my prices lower than the previous package which had  +   have 4 tata sky connections 1 primary and 3 multi tv you have to pay full cost for primary and 250 each for multi tv  ut of the 4 s  2 are  supporting and other 2 are old school   was paying 750 for my primary and another 250+250+250 for my other connections  had all    channels tata sky offers on its platformow if  subscribe to a  channel   dont get its corresponding  channel with it o i cant watch  channels now    think these new  rules will benefit us in the long runs people start subscribing lesser number of channels  expect broadcasters to reduce their prices hannels will lose a great deal of advertising revenue if they continue to price their channels so highy opinion  ait and watch for a couple of months hings will become clear  ome people here and in other similar threads claim that hotstar and onyliv is a viable alternative ts simply not for sports ve a decent net plan  around 50mbps  and yet  when ndia plays  the quality is pathetic  ooks like 144p even when you select full    ts alright while watching on your phone but you simply cant watch it on your   tom 250 earlier to a steep 610 this monthuck you  and your evolutionary step  ptv is your friend here are bouquet bundled channels from company  egimes now hd bouquet at 15rs includes mn+ movies now mnx romedy now etchoose the channels wisely  for me it has reduced from 400 to 230rs from my understanding  this whole exercise was to make dth expensive and complicated for the normal household so that when jiofiber comes with all inclusive plan  customers would flock to it and dth companies would disappear the same way most of the telecom companies have disappeared in the end  only tata sky might survive along with airtel  o people actually still watch  ine went from 420 a month to 320  think o for a google certified android box or you are in luck if you have android tv   prefer online apps maybe one day they will come up with providing the option of the individual channel pay on    ait for  cable to come  it will be cheap then ey  lets not blame  hey are really laying foundation for the future by forcing people to cut cabke dth and move to online services hat an idea  deleted  ude thats very reasonable ,10

and sprints progressed and completed wo alf arathons ought bike cycle  and along with running  ride 2550 kms f you cant bike daily  then on weekend ride 3050kms t looks daunting but your legs will get used to it tart adminton tart wimmingchedule 23 times running 12 times adminton 12 times ike 12 times swimmingow start looking into arathons ualthon raithlon orget social media and open account in

378,he witchs broth https  wwwredditcom r india comments cswj9h the witchs broth    would like to add a few more pointsur education is failure maybe because our society is obsessed with percentages rather than the knowledge gained he evaluation is so flawed that if you know the tricks you can literally write a movie script for any question and still score full marks for iteople with degrees who earned it by cheating  tricking  and false evaluation are no less than the uneducated and ignorant mass ome of these people again use loopholes in the job market and attain high positions in companies only to belittle the hardworking ones here was a country of imbeciles  all of whom secretly harbored delusions of their own greatnessut they were ruled by a select few who  while being of the same stock as the imbeciles  had risen above their level of stupidity by virtue of having access to an education system that was denied to the vast majorityhis elite took advantage of the general brainlessness that prevailed among the masses  and ruled over them simply by impressing upon them that they were stupid  and needed someone intelligent to rule over them ut this went on for long enough  and then some among the many woke up to the fact that if the imbeciles were in a majority  why not instil among them the idea that their imbecility  far from being a bane  was in fact a virtue hus  they could overthrow the elite  who had in any case let generations of opulent living dull them into a lazy corpulence  and become the rulers themselveshis worked better than even they had hoped  for the imbeciles were tired of whispering their inanities among the likeminded few  or so they had thought n fact  the mindless were an overwhelming majority pon realizing that for the first time  the rulers did not look down upon their stupidity  but in fact echoed their inane blathering  they began in everincreasing numbers to shout out evidence of their own idiocy from the rooftops hus  for the first time in this countrys history  the ruled had found themselves in complete harmony with their rulers  hey cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great racehose who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past eorge rwell in 1984 very nation gets the government it deservesoseph de aistre  live in the  and  used to wonder how  took over yria ast month my yrian neighbor said  e all supported  because they talked about our religion  nationalism and the most glorious past of yria that they were trying to bring back e all stood by and watched as  massacred our own brothers and sisters because they promised to make yria great again  the saddle of creation that it once was  the real yria that the whole world respected  ut they just wanted to make some money from our oil fields his government is of the unkils  by the unkils and for the unkilse should thank our luck for there still being such a thing as internet taught myself evolution by natural selection until  grokked it thanks to the internet  especially books by awkins and  and  documentaries   taught myself interesting ideas discovered by astronomy thanks to the eaching ompany  learned to be skeptic and think critically thanks to ovellas keptic uide to the niverse podcast  learned about how our debtbased world economy has been stuttering through booms and busts since ixons 1971 decision  learned from ate agens about how surplus energy is the driver of economy  not money  learned what science has learned about plants by watching hamovitz course on oursera learned why ndian science didnt develop after 1200  by watching  this lecture  https  wwwyoutubecom watchvmhn7xxg  by reakthrough cience ocietyou wont believe how awed  feel every dayut  also understand that the civilization as we know it is heading for collapse by 2050 o  theres some sadness too  am learning to die in the anthropocene ou fail to understand education system ducation is nothing more than a social experiment t only helps the individual to conform to the societal norms ocietal norms keep on changing with the tide of time he current acceptability standards in ndian context are towards a majoritarian cultural and nationalistic tendencies ducation will only fall in line to create individuals who conform to those standards ust wow old toh nahi hai  cookie from my side uch is the pathetic condition of the education system in ndia that having  in hysics is also not enough to make a person educated in hysics or else why would a former lecturer of physics claim that eisenbergs uncertainty principle is found in edas hy would a judge claim that peacocks reproduce with their tears hy would another judge declare that rahmins are born twice hy would an  claim that that the edas postulated a theory superior to lbert insteins theory of relativity hese people did go to schools and universities ut unfortunately  these schools and universities failed to give them an educationn ndia  a lot of us are not well educated e are expensively educated n 1453  just before the fall of the city  the intellectuals of onstantinople were discussing the gender of angels ho are you  bro emember  all these crazy shit is brought forward by people brave enough to speak such bsho knows how much more crazy thoughts they have they dont bring out  here is a witchs broth being cooked  a diabolical concoction of patriotism  pseudoscience  the glorification of the past  nationalism  occultism  militarism and ignorance ndia is going down a slippery slopehis line basically hits the nail on the head for me or a while ve kinda thought about what ationalism was and how different is it from atriotism  m just picking these two for now  but willing to talk about the others as well  basically came to the my current conclusion    might be quite wrong  so please correct me if you believe so  atriotism is where we believe in the idea of the country that it was founded on n our case a ecular  emocratic epublic  land where all are welcome regardless of their beliefs  religion  caste  creed  race or anything people have used to differentiate each other  for better or for worse   land where the people choose  elect and stand by the those they have elected to lead and govern ot rule over  lace where diversity is celebrated  protected and understoodationalism is this idea that one person or group of persons are superior to others and they alone have the right to rule over all the others he others are basically on this earth to destroy it and therefore need to be subjugated and herded  r ruled  r in some cases destroyed so as to purify the race ifferences are highlighted and weaponized to gain power o  when  hear people calling themselves ationalistic or group of nationalists  it does worry me since  see them as possibly being so enslaved by this idea of superiority that they will be willing to do anything for it nd that is scary quality post right here ermans had very advanced tech for those times but the majority populace were systematically brainwashed  into thinking that the jews were main reason  for all their problems hank you so much for writing this anity is refreshing these days ow all weve got to do is  this from   he biggest flaw in everything youve written is that you think that these rulers believe in what they say hey dont  they just have to make you think they do udges have to pass exams  or win cases as lawyers before they are so elevated t is the easiest conclusion hen your staying in power depends on you lying to the people about a nonexistent past  as a power hungry  devious and clever politician  will you pander to the millions and millions of uneducated semieducated  or to the handful of people who will try to counter you with science in a battle which science cannot win v come to realise that the biggest failure of our education system is that it has not taught critical thinking reasoning skills to people  see it on my hatspp groups where educated people are ready to believe any kind of fake news conforming to their wordviews eople who pride themselves on their technical knowledge and look at data 10 times before coming to a conclusion  are ready to accept any  in terms of politics or history e are happy to accept anything told to us by a person in authority ecause thats what schools and parents have taught us to do isten to elders  do not question  write the answer exactly in this format to score marks etc his seems like a very good essay with words coming straight out of the heart of someone who cares for his her country  agree with all the points you made ou correctly pointed out the issues in our education system  social fabric etc which are now transcending to an unprecedented national level nd it is really worrisome but then who will voice them when we cant even do it in front of our relatives and closed friends hey have taken the blue pill and want to live their ignorant lives not actually caring about this at all n their view  they are deep patriotic because they are supporting a buffoon who seems to have patented this so called nationalism he first step in solving any problem is recognizing that we have one nless this happens  there is no bright future f we want to rise up as a society  we need to develop a scientific temperament e need to rely on facts rather than rumors e need to question everything we can nd a good education will only take you so far  it will be ultimately this very society which will make or break our future  which seems to be going downhill for some time   want to take a peek at your bookshelf   ell now that we have  once again  identified the problems  what is going to fix the countryf the plan is  criticise so that people get awarem sorry but thats not gonna work uppose  am a bhakt and  start seeing that  is not what  had in mind pay attention to you and wake uphat do  do nexto  vote for ongress             etc can present examples of religious bigotry and stupidity from all of these parties s many as from  hat do  do  as an individual  when my choices are limited like this  couple days ago i overhead a conversation among 3 people for 10 seconds while doing some work his guy started by saying to the other two  ey have you guys heard about ashmir  i have no idea but i think  nd the other two also agreed that they have no idea about the facts of the matter and continued say utter bullshit and some communal things too just sighed  got up and left ould it kill people to just pick up a good newspaper and fucking read a paragraph or two about the thing and then talk ust read about the damn facts if you want to talk or voice your opinion about anything ish we had an taturk somewhere   dont know if that is even possible in an fractious democracy such as ours ery well written post ould love to hear your solution to this ell written mate hat you said is actually quite true nd its not just our education system but the social media as well as news media  am a resident of olhapur which was a victim of the recent flood disaster e the residents did everything in our to save the lives of those who were affected by the flood nd  didnt see a single media person who talked about that instead it was just who took a press conference and talked and whatnot he edia is blind about the real situation that they will start to blame anyone without even knowing the real issue nd  feel ashamed to admit that in our country it matters a lot one of the leaders keep their promises and play the same tape for the next elections nd its literally unimaginable but also very true that the people fall for the same thing again and again and again like a sheep ts disgusting f anyone of you had read the hiva rilogy he am handra eries of books  then theres a really cool philosophy that was presented by mish ripathi in the books unno if the philosophy is actually his  but  that was my first source of this informationt states that the system of governance  and the region of governance  both follow a cyclic mode  of switching between two systems  called as the masculine system  and the feminine system he feminine system  is based on freedom  creativity  and a light structure to allow said creativity to flourish and grow the system he masculine system  is based on rigid rules  duty  and honour of service etc s you can see  they are entirely opposite systems  and hence  clash heavily with each othernfortunately for ndia  we might be in some sort of a transition from a feminine system  to a masculine system  within emocracy  which doesnt make much sense  as democracy works best with a feminine system ure  the eople take forever to debate and make a correct decision  but  at the end  theres not much doubt about its correctness n the other hand  decisions in the masculine system are swift  and very strongly executed  although theres no time for the public to determine whether its right or wrong  before the decision is finalizedt heir doomtimes  feminine systems become corrupt and unjust  and people wish for a masculine system n the same way  a masculine system becomes fanatical  clinging to old lory  not letting it go and restart  and hence  falls to forced implementation of a feminine system  mostly due to some sort of a war hope we dont come to this sort of a fanatical end his is very good writing onsidering this is your first post its make it more enjoyable   dont know exact word  want to use  s it just me or neither have my parents nor grandparents nor my aunts or uncles have told me or any of my cousins anesha has plastic surgery or urukshetra had an atom bomb dropped on it or that aj ahal was a hiv temple asy to state problems hat are the solutions onderful o you have a fix ilarious that you used ermany as an example he modern day advancements of   ussia etc have a lot to do with what they pillaged from ermany after the war including soft power  etter that you read more about it  ery well thought and written apists and mob lynchers are given garlands in our country upreme court and the constitution is in the s pocket     ny solutions for this  nyway to reverse this brainwash  am agonised and feel helpless watching people turning into insensitive  hateful and communal bigots over these past 5 years  even those people who were largely neutral or never showed too much interest in politics can easily emigrate   ut  dont want to ecause  have many good friends and relatives here  my family business is doing very well and  work at a ndian   dont want to abandon all of this just because some nazi party is in power hat a brilliant post ind blowingly accurate  wish  could be as articulate as you about thisdit ou need to submit it to some newspaper re you a journalist  ow that the ignoramus became leaders he buffoons started finding ndic greatness hen ignorants come to power hen ignorants achieve powerhis kind of language doesnt help things nobbishness and elitism wont help you get your arguments across our opponents will shut themselves off to anything you have to say hey can easily afford to do so think instead we must sincerely engage with them to understand where they are coming from hat complaints  fears or aspirations drive them s there anything at all of worth in their arguments s there anything at all that the rest of us can learn from their positions o we have blind spots and prejudices of our ownts easy to sink into despair and hate ut if we answer hatred with hatred  it will only polarize the society even further nstead  we must work from an authentic state of compassion towards others without being patronizing ltimately  whether we like it or not  were in this all together ou call them igorants and buffoons resumably you hold yourself to be a more sophisticated thinker than them urely using your superior knowledge and wisdom  you must be able to get them to see where youre coming from hile  agree with much of what you say  i think youre not paying the deliberate push by the leadership to get the masses to follow more and more stupider causes emember  the mob that pulled the mosq down in 1992 did not appear in ayodhya spontaneously o basically this all is ehrus fault f only our education system was better than what it was the past 70 years ot sure if to put  s or not ow  ell written ere an i aat hile the problems you state are true  the criticism is overboard and the projection that we are heading into 2 ermany is clear over exaggeratione all here agree that the problem of misinformation is mostly in the generation we term as unkils and we see them around us in our own families does it not mean it is not entirely reflection of their views as people but the impact poor understanding of nternet and modern technology by the their generation lso  winning elections and running country are entirely different things ne cannot win elections by good governance alone o they resort to publicity tactics as well  am not justifying the actions but what  mean is though their words make them look like fools when taken literally  they are doing it for a reason and the educated are not the target audience for those statements  removed  ont forget llah split moon into 2 pieces wiw this is global  ook at the moon hoax folks  the anti vaxers or the flat landers  all of them are educated in schools and yet   emagoguery one more ecca edina me shiv ling   alk about discriminatory sentiments  whatever your political leanings may be  this was a reductive and poor take on politics our opinion on the fake news spread by bhakts and unkils are correct owever  arent you spreading similar things by claiming we are turning into azi ermany his is exactly what the opposition did for the last 5 years hey claimed there was undeclared emergency  minorities will be sent to concentration camps etc but it was nothing but fear mongering and it played into the hands of  he words  aj ahal was not built by hahjahan t was a hiva temple still rings in my earst is an inferiority complex  it will go away when our society progresses enough or eg hinese would  till some 3040 years ago  give examples of how their civilization was the greatest  it invented paper money  gunpowder etc etc ow they dont care because they know that they have moved so far ahead that they dont care what happened in past  for the most part   civilization like us which has for almost a millennia had foreign rule subjugation would need some time to recoverhese fools were relegated mostly to tasks that did not need  intellectual acumen hey did their servile jobs and nurtured the pride  that anesha had the first plastic surgery hey did their thankless  duties and passed on their ignorance to their children ut someday   these fools had to come to prominence and they did hey started winning  electionsh come on hat is life without some mythology  used to be fascinated about my late grandfather paternal grandfathers elder brother  telling me stories about hesh aag balancing earth on his head  knew this wasnt true  but it was really interesting to hear his beliefs nd he would often say  ano to bhagwan  nahi to patthar  what more rationality could you ask from an older generation of your familyhy would another judge declare that rahmins are born twice am out of loop  but   dont understand what is wrong in calling rahmins twiceborn rahmins are considered  dvij  dvi janmana iti  dont remember which samas it is   ie taking birth twice  once when they are born and once when

diabolical concoction a witches brew of innuendo and rumourude hy he wizards elixirvery eligion  ulture or ation have their myths  stories  and legends hile most of them are false some of them do hold their foundations in the truth hey are just told through the form of oral tradition  and like everything that travels through oral communication tends to change a little bit in every retelling  so it is very mature of you to call out their lack of education for such a small matter  while you  me and everyone are sitting here because of these uneducated peoples hardwork without the facilities being this good in that time and age nd still  there are many things from these stories or idiots blabbering as you call them  that are proven to be correct by sciencet is known that egotism is the bane of a man et so many people never let it go  and hold on to the poison that keeps corrupting them and never let them see anything other than what they want to see and believe ou claim that our parents  grandparents uncle and aunts have shoved us towards ignorance and false pride  but that couldnt be more wrong   speak for myself and many many people  have known throughout my life that my and their parents have done everything to make sure we pursue education and enlightenment neducated they may be but they have given all their life to make us capable of our own judgment and every time they told us stories like you mentioned they also told us to research ourself if we want to believe it or not nd your biggest mistake is in thinking that we  who believe them  are stupid and mindwashed  but let me tell you most of the people you call bhakts and idiots and other things without getting to know them are well educated and believe in things because we are educated ou and other propaganda spreaders will know that if they actually knew who they were spreading the propaganda about  but you just amuse we are illiterate and idiots and most ndians are pompous fools  lol  very educated of you to assume what most bhakts are  ut by all means keep doing that and it is our gain n ego  a man thinks he is right and everyone else is wrong and that is where he she is most wrong ats  said maybe stories change  but even then there is no proof that you can show that the stories are wrong  other than calling everyone idiot hile on the other hand there are proofs supporting the stories if not directly proving them right g maybe anesha has had a plastic surgery  by the way i have never seen someone say this to me  or maybe he hadnt  but there is proof that ancient ndia was very capable of doing it  read about ushruta t is a proven fact that he could do many complex surgeries including that lso  it was way before even the terms for them were coined ncient ndia was very much advanced in technology  metallurgy  and medicine oga  yurveda  omeopathy  amascus steel  ushruta and many other things and people being examples nd if something hasnt yet been proven right  does not mean it is wrongh yes  the great argument that government has illiterates ave you heard about eorge ashington  braham  rinivas amanujan  enry ord  rederick ouglass and many more  they were are illiterates in their fields  yet no one has does enough for humanity  science  mathematics  people and countries than them  whoever came up with the idea that educated people can only do great things does not know about what he is talking es  education helps but a great man  a great leader is someone who does better with what they have given and does not complain about the things like   was not educated enough  or education was bot available at my time nd who said educated people only do good  smaninladen was a ivil engineer  rump is graduate in inance  im ongun studied in witzerland before pursuing militarily university  they sure have set standards highes everything we say is vomiting and yet you are a man of class and every time you speak jewels rain down ol  just because anskrit is the bestplaced language to be great for coding doesnt mean we have anything to do with it  and why are you butthurt even if we did try to research that  research is always being done on number of things  most of which are meaningless just to find something that is not  it is called research for a reason  but you are clearly hurt by that  why you clearly have something against it  is it that you are a akistani agenda spreader with your fake bought account nd who are you to hold anyone responsible what have you done with your esteem educated self h right  you called most of us pompous idiots and duffers  so yeah that was a good use of education   wonder why any politician didnt think of that  clearly they need to study moreou call azis ignorant and idiots seriously  they were bad people  but ignorant and idiots they were not  they are famous for their mindset to improve technology and cience hey were the creators of some unmatched technology of that time hey worked and researched all the time to improve their technology and they did it  it took most of the world and countless good lives to pin them down ust because they drew their inspirations from the past does not negate what they were good at ut you just have to draw a line to match urrent ndia to azi ermany  just to further your propaganda  so you do not care about doing even a bit research or checking if what you are saying is true in the least f azi ermany were to be good people then today they would be most educated and technologically advanced people of our time  but you only care about drawing false parallelshose people who believe in something just because someone has said some things by sugarcoating a few words are like everyone who is believing your propaganda without actually thinking of what you are really talking about hen wrongdoers and people who like to just spread false information think that their stupid stuff is not working anymore  they try to call others stupid  duffers  idiots  etc but that wont fool anyone who has a mind of their ownn this post of yours  you have called most of us  stupid  idiot  duffers  and whatnot while never writing anything worth a chimps intelligence  if this is what educated people are like   am glad most of my country is illiterate as you claim and idiots#x200 o  stop putting so must shit in that broth of yours or someone will find out that you are literally cooking some shit hat rubbish is this ndians regularly focus on education  its pretty much a core tenet of ndian culture across all states and locationsost of this stuff in this thread is toxic the kind of stuff that leads one to believe that being governed by a few elite is better than the will of the many  voted for  in last two elections but my parents have never mentioned such stupid stuff  they always voted for congress prior to these elections and this time they didnt vote at all ot everyone voting for bjp has the same background  have congress rule from up close and know how corrupt they are  dont give a fuck about azi comparisons or any other fear mongering and so does the majority of ndia,11

realize how good he has it  ilk price went by single digit rupeesoesnt milk cost 8 for a gallon in  the underpaid maid asked for a raise  he is angryes not going to have a maid in   whos going to take care of him thenoney isnt a thing   guess he has a rose tinted view of  for some reason f you were living in urope then  could understand his excitement for living there but  wont prefer living in  in old age edicines are expensive and you have got no one to help you unless the wife is a homemaker ry to make him understand how things are in  ell him that things arent cheap and you cant haggle lumbers and maids will empty his pockets f hes complaining about neighbours now  what makes him think mericans around you  or even ndians living around you will be ecstatic to talk to him es just the complaining type  its alright   you do you oms are great  they usually have their duties they do everyday  and have done so for years  ncluding worrying about you  and tryhing to help  ads are great  if they have something to do in retirement  owever  ads who focused on money at work and ignored family with no retirement plan execpt to hang out at home are trouble  hey did what they did and focued on oney for the family  and little else  f they dont have a retirment buisness  they feel abandonded by kids who are not at home asking for advice  and being able to give it  etirment for the middle class will not be kind in the onsumer ra with ntrest rates higher than 3  asically in this situation  inflation of 712 is making stuff out of reach for what he could buy when he was working and intrest rates are a bit less than inflationven if there were grandkids to take to school and bring back  he would feel abandonded and unable to contribute  omething simple as being a landlord will give him puropose or managing some property for you  n other words  he needs a purpose where profit is involved nstead of being stewing his how his retirment income cant keep up with and increasing costs  nd we are not taking about simple things  we are talking about asparational consumerism  e keeping up with the neighbors and former colleagues  who have moved to better places using their sons money   nless you are giving him tons of money  or he does not have a job he wont be happyhe other thing to keep in mind  ndia is not what it was  ity dewalks and public transport are unusable by the older folks  dads included   ndia was not about making infrastructure usable for older folks to get out of the hosue  o when the average congested neihbroorhood streets get ripped up for bigger cars  there is no place local place to walk to  he wealtheir have the manicured lawns and gated communiteis  o they need to use the more expensive transportation  which they didnt use when they were working  nd even frustrates me   imagine how it bothers your dad ave you considered advising or arranging for your father to seek psychiatric help alnut one per day  shelled opened before eating  eaten before dinner   1  ask doctor if he is on any medication if its ok to eat walnuts  2  if he is on blood thinners medication then also you cant do this y life changedy mums life changedy entire house changedf it works out for you  let me know in a week and pay it forward ell them about the gun violence shootings in  ell them about the racism not whites have to face ell them about the cost of living maid etc lso how most of the people may feel homesick in   how bad the kulcha is there  people hooking up left and right etc es complaining most probably because he wants to move to the  s someone said  if its possible to get him a short trip  he might see the conditions there and help him decide on what to do you should be proud of your ather that hes not a hakt hings are how you expect it to be  not great for all  but nothing bad specifically for elders ith an average 5 inflation rate prices are bound to go up he infrastructure in this country has almost always been the same with snail paced improvementooks like his frustration is not just about society in general but could be something else ou mentioned that you do send money for them ow do you think its going to be any different after you come back omething existss dad ada vom vom vada vom vom vada vom es retired  my guess is he doesnt really have a hobby to pass the time o he is using the national pass time  getting angry at trivial things his is what happens when you work your ass off on a job and then when you get home you are too tired to do anything else ou dont know what to do with your life after retirementsk your dad to ditch hatsapp  outube garbage and do something productive with his time omething he can enjoy doing eah sure this sounds like child parenting the parent  but this is what he needsou can also try getting him a pet ets are wonderful creature and can help regulate behavioral problems in people ven something as low maintenance like a parrot can do the trick saving this thread hoping for an answer we are lucky that a close relative stays at our place to take care of my parents  we provide housing and food obviously and send money home for food and related expenses  but yes we are always on tenterhooks as life under odis rule things are very very unpredictable  in our area  maids and assorted labour like gardners  plumbers etc seem to have disappeared and we have to get them from very far off food pricing hikes is another pain in the neck  things like flooding and riots etc  just mean more tension for us out here ut so far we have managed to get by all thanks to the one guy staying with my parents  y question to you folks  are any of your parents in such a situation o ut   am in your parents situation  complaining sourpuss ou will have to ask my kids few years from now rought my parents to the  for a months visit hey dont want to come back ocia life sucks  food sucks  no one on the roads  too cold  every thing is so far away etc were some of the reasons t seems like the problems youve mentioned arent the ones that are really the cause of their irritation robably they are just anxious and a little stressed out about something ould be because its a new place  or because you arent around them  or some other thing in their lives ou need to help them feel secure and comfortable  and really address the source of their anxiety hey dnt have hobbies,11
385,ood apps scam spread the word https  wwwredditcom r india comments br8ypj food apps scam spread the word   id zomato ask you before putting discount on your food  he 40 percent discount of omato is running will cost e another 5070 rupees  would end up selling the burger for 130 and then there is 5 percent gst too this unethical behavior is killing restaurants nd local businessesan you explain why restaurants are bearing the discount that omato is giving  when omato is supposed to bear the discount provided by them pdate ome of you have some common questions which  will answers for source simply call omato ask them you want to sign with them whats the contract they offer it ill not be below 25 eople saying without them  would not have orders that far its true but  before they started their own delivery  omato  my boys would go 78 kilometers for even a order worth 160  omato use to be a website to look for restaurants you could not order my boys since hen have been going for 78 ilometers astly to end this topic omato is soon making a place where you would have to buy your raw aterials from them only which is known as hyperpure which ill become mandatory to buy from according to my account manager if we want to work with them even wiggy is buying paces taking restaurants nder that space and selling the restaurants item under wiggys name  as someone whos been  in the industry for 12 ears you can choose to believe me or the company but if it continues the way it is many for your favorite places will shutdown thanks guys for hearing me out its been a tough year for restaurants   ldr omato wiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this heating is strong word hey arent cheating anyone but a lot of their business practice is outright predatory ont restuarant owners have unions f not  you guys should unionize and negotiate better deals with these companies n omato and wiggys war for customerbase  small businesses suffer ts the same thing with ber taxis  they scam the taxi drivers by charging large commissions off an already low taxi fare lso restaurant owners send half filled boxes when people apply such discounts to make up the loss  so you both are riding the same boat hv noticed this numerous times in different cities  try vising the restaurant and getting parcel in person  youll notice theyll use smaller sized packages while sending food via zomato   let me tell you how to solve this problem but youll have to become a little tech savvy for that n une  there is a restaurant called ehrouz iryani who were facing similar problem as yours  let me tell you how they solved it  used to order biryani from there through omato hen  repeatedly ordered biryani about 45 times  they texted me a special offer f  purchased through their app in the lay tore  instead of omato   theyll give me an additional whopping 20 discount compared to the present price figured out they must be facing the same issue as yours omato  the middle man must be eating all their profits through discounts and delivery charges but if they  ehrouz iryani  had their own app in the lay tore  people will order directly from there and they can be offered a much better price now heyll have to arrange logistics but it should be trivial if you are running an established restaurant for a long timery that   app development is not that difficult these days atch a trustworthy techie and either hell code it himself for you  or hell know a freelancer friend wholl do it he future belongs to those who know how to ace the technological race e know ost of us still order for the convenience he argument put forth could be that omato wiggy are bringing you new customers that would otherwise never visit your restaurant in person  and so any business is good business  no matter how small the margins may beowever  on further thinking  the food app economy is killing the lets go out for dinner economy o less customers over time will choose to visit your restaurant and prefer ordering online  which will cut into your normal profits  and limit your ability to maintain rent electric etc costs of running a physical restaurant think the endgame is to have every outlet on omato wiggy eventually turn into a kitchenfront only  working on minimal margins  with the middleman taking most of the profit  just for providing what used to be a free service  enus + calling restaurants for delivery  imilar findings could be made in the ber la economy etc ad  but this is late stage capitalism at work lease stop supporting omato  was at a roll stall yesterday and  asked the seller about how omato earns as a middlemanservice when youre the one charging for service and the customer is paying to you e explained it to me and  was like  o how does it benefit you if they charge you money e said  hey bring us work  was like  o they nd he responded  o  not really ere making the same as before  except now omato takes away a portion of our earnings i   a quick question for youets say youre selling a burger via swiggy for 140   f  were to eat at your restaurant  will  be charged the same hats the cost of an instore customer versus one who orders via wiggy or omato f  order online  you save money you otherwise incur on sitting space  electricity  waiter charges  etcont you think when you account for all this  the money you lose to commissions and discounts on wiggy omato is same as what you would incur on an instore customer he business model is based on optimistic high volume saleses i believe this stupid 30 10 loss bearing system should go away ut this model also gets you a higher number of orders  which otherwise you were supposed to rely on your loyal customerso if you were selling 10 burgers to your loyal customers and were earning 10  per burgerot youre obviously selling atleast 20+ burgers at maybe 5 profit  plus the customers who walk into your restaurantnd moreover  its consistent earning ts a win win situation  if there is a better loss bearing system nd restaurant owners also send stale  unedible  low quantity  half orders etc food which on our complaint zomato bears the refund cost o  i dont think its only zomatos fault if people keep looking to earn money by fraud methods hich part is a scam and how are they cheating the customer s it the commission they charge you or the discount which is passed on to the clients or the delivery fee they are charging am sorry if this comes across as rude but if you are setting up a business relying on a 3rd party to drive orders then you cant say they are scamming you if you dont make as much money as them  restaurant near my place stuck to their guns and had their own delivery service hey are doing quite well f theres a restaurant union near your place  pool in some money and start your own online delivery service ou dont need stuff like fancy  tracking systems  good payment gateway and order delivering on time will suffice  often order food online  wiggy  and the shit they pull off with the discounts is outright shady heyll inflate the prices  give discount and bring the total bill to the same price as it was earlier lso   was at this restaurant a few days ago  frequently order chicken 65 from this restaurant which is priced around 170  if you buy directly from the restaurant  and 210  if you order from wiggy   so what ve realized is that wiggy not only inflates the prices but also adds taxes  packaging charges  and delivery charges which knocks up the price to almost 250 which makes no sense  used to work at an  aa company startup hey make website for the restaurant  with their branding and theme and all   where customer can directly place the order  estaurant get better margin  and they can offer reasonable discount  he competition of wiggy and omato had really killed the business from their website almost for most of the clients#x200 urger ing used to run a lot of discount on their website  but had dropped their website for ordering completely ndian mentality is cheap and wants discounts everywhere  will legitimately give more money to apps to click and order instead of talking on the phone for ordering and haggling with the delivery person for change ell me straightforwardhat is the  net margin on your business an you put together more facts and figures  to help use understand the issue lso  doesnt these apps increase the number of orders for your restaurant  ow do you factor that in  uh  for a year now ve been noticing that a plate of utton iryani from wellknown and popular joints  here in hennai  like uhari  indigul halapakatti etc  have priced it around s270290 or so rior to that it used to be around the s 180220 range  depending on the restaurant  ure  the prices of other dishes might have obviously been hiked too  but as for now  this is whats coming in my minds the increase in price have to do with what  has posted here r is it just normal and typical  due to inflation and all  and m just overstating things here ut   nearly  300rs for a plate of utton iryani is just ridiculous  especially for the portion size that is provided to us  imo o you think going for a online only restaurant might help reduce your costs ou will be able to rent some small space for just the kitchen  and it doesnt have to be in the main road remember reading that these type have kitchens have started becoming popular in  re there such kitchens operating in ndia now uess its ber heats ust curious  do u prepare omato wiggy ber ats orders differently from when a customer orders directly from you or eats in your restaurant hanks op  have heard that now they are opening their own kitchen   they would make high selling food items which are high in demands   its brilliant not having to maintain a shop and just a kitchen when can be at a strategic place in city and on whatever place or floor they want and i have heard they are going to recommend their own itchen food since it would be tremendously cheaper since absolutely no or minimal working cost is associated with it   but this is very unjust for all the restaurant business owners because they will finally lose those who actually started using the platform because of the restraunts customers and they certainly cant compete in terms of cost to an outlet specially enhanced for online order  ts clearly very njustice to everyone  may be late to comment on this but  after with  that zomato earns around 100rs per order  ccording to one calculation of mine at my local hinese food stall zomato was earning 40 apart from delivery charges and all ome restaurants in my area are not on zomato or swiggy they are old restaurants and they get a decent footfall from their loyal customers ne restaurant dhaba  used to go frequently cos of good food and fast service was almost empty in what used to be a rush hour ut side of it was a number of delivery boys waiting for the orders  feel people coming to restaurants was more profitable for restaurants then people ordering  always wondered who is paying the discount  to the restaurant noticed the price hike as well  earlier the price of jeera rice was 150  after a week or 2 it hiked to 230 was like why r post made it all clear thanks op nstead of crying wolf  have you thought of quitting from zomato or swiggy hat way you dont need to worry about being cheated u luebaleno damn my mom was right all long  good that she forces me to get up my lazy ass and go to the restaurant from where  want the food ever actually thought about the restaurant owners ve also noticed that theres a discrepancy in the prices quoted in the omato wiggy apps  those quoted on the actual menus in the restaurant he prices on the app are higher by at least 20 rupees for almost every item ith all the major food delivery apps   berats and wiggy are all operating at a loss o   think only the consumers are winning ts not a scam ts called the market hese apps can charge whatever margin they want f you dont like you can order from an alternativets not like there is some law fixing food prices on omato ust being the devils advocate here for what  mentions hats a sustainable business model for them bare in mind these are not just the only costs ersonnel cost  this includes the tech people paid premium packages given that the scale is huge  and the delivery perating server costs  o ordinary stuff considering the reliability and availability requirements of such a massive business  ayment gateway fees usually 4 maybe slightly lower due to their scale  osses ruled in favor of the  customer aking up for the discounts offered to lure more consumer base especially fickle consumers in ndia and advertisingts naive to just look at it from an end consumer perspective nyone whose run an online business must know how much money is spent on the intangibles  personally understand when consumers stakeholders like  post this but their expectations are ignorant at times if not inconsiderate  aving said that  do not like the discount being forced down your throat    could you confirm if there is an opt out of such discount for you guys   ve worked for quite a few startups under the ecommerce umbrella as a tech guy  such margins are norm  that corporations are sleazy magine that  ave you imagined that without zomato or swiggy you couldnt sell the burger in the first place o one will travel 5km for a burgerhere no concept called potential sale ithout food delivery service you cant even sell the burger ery difficult to read and understand your post man ut elivery companies will obviously charge you   they are delivering your food to the costumer plus they are providing you a platform to get discovered by more and more peoplehe only issue  can see here is the forced discount thing because they app is providing claiming discount not the restaurant   so apps should give discount from their pocket  an someone please explain me this properly  think you people should try forming some kind of unions o omato and wiggy have no one to get food from and they are forced to treat you guys better pvoting for better reach f you cant afford then why dont you stop the promotion discount  bet no app put gun on your head ou could say no to discount he model the apps are running are not sustainable as of now   know e all know these details  heard some south ndian state is going to take action ee if you could help in the cause  230 for a burger amn  hats too expensive for me m a broke ass students so  wouldnt know what its like to eat 230  burger ven the zinger is 140ish something  guess o restaurants prepare higher quality food for non discounted over the phone orders he places  used to order from a couple of years ago delivered great food although at higher prices ow when  order through apps ve noticed even though the bill is cheaper the quality is not at par in a lot of places s this done by restaurants to try to keep up with the discounts hanks for sharing eally appreciate your experience in this  dont fully understand your problem with the delivery charge though  isnt that a part of their expenses e as customers should pay some amount for it  rightlso   hope you dont mind but its a little difficult to understand your post s you mentioned  this isnt your first language and  truly respect your effort in trying to inform us on this important issueseres how  would edit your post  if it helps  try seeing what ve cut out ill help you write clearer the next timei   own a restaurant and  just wanted to bring something to light his is the reason why your food is expensiveompanies like wiggy  omato and ber ats charge us restaurants a 25 per cent commission on every order we get or example  a burger sells for s 250 inus the commission  it is s 200 n top of that  their discounts end up killing restaurants and bring the value down even further for us or example  omatos 40per cent discount of omato will cost me s 5070 rupees on the same burger  which  would end up selling for s130 n top of that is a 5 per cent his unethical behaviour is killing restaurants and local businesses2  hey charge you the customer a  2535 rupees for delivery per order omato earns almost 100 rupees from you and   understand its a business model  but you need profits and the discounts that they are running will shut us down our favourite small time businesses will shut down very soon if this continues   omato  wiggy  ber ats cheat restaurants and customers with their pricing and discount schemes apologize for the way  have written as nglish is not my first language ts actually one of the few times ve written in nglish  and that too  on such a long topic ope you understand lways knew there has to be something behind those crazy discounts ooks like the restaurant is being fucked over by the ompanies ou get orders because of omato omato has the right to enter into arrangement with you and it is up to you to accept or notont understand the issue here t seems like you just want to make more money while having the  same volume as you get through omato ant have it both ways n a free market economy  fairness in competition is touted to be the usp n reality  it is the market itself that makes profit while the long tail of market participants die hose that survive are usually owned by the market itselfor eg if youre swiggy  the bowl company  owned by swiggy  belongs to the top 5 and brings in much more revenue than the entire long tail combined causing them to shut down imilar with mazons brands like solimo etcn essence  this is anti competitive and would have resulted in the government to intervene  had it been some other country he only real force stopping anti competitive practices is legislation  which our country is pissant at  live in ingapore  m not sure about the markets here  but what happens there is that the sellers increase the price of the items available on the apps ou can get the same thing for about 70 the cost if you buy it directly from the restaurant an confirm 2225 of revenue goes to omato wiggy acking up prices to list therefore is inevitable ood business opportunity to help small restaurants set up mobile optimized store fronts and bypass swiggy or tomato s a restaurant owner what changes would you like to see  ny proposal on how to let the such companies earn also  f the company didnt offer delivery but  just listed your menu will you get into an agreement with them  have absolutely no problem with thishose delivery orders would never be available for you without those appsou will be serving to the same customer base and delivery to same people who order and live with in 1015 minutes of your restauranthile  have no doubt the food apps engage in some scummy behavior and strong arm restaurants  restaurateurs need to realize that extra delivery business orders that they generate will not be available for them without these appsow you choose to deal with that is their prerogative wont order from a restaurant that is pretty far away from my location unless its through the food delivery appsy business will be limited to nearby restaurantsts the delivery apps that enable restaurants to get orders from outside their normal circleou cant expect to get maximum profit from these  25 commission + 40 discount + 5 ncrease the price of the burger then nd learn some business tactics or economics iking the price then offering a discount gives you more sales than offering the product at the original price  ou have a hiked up price  which gives you a higher profit margin se the margin to offer discounts in your own app  if you have one   or for dinein customers via ineout omato oldiscounts have the psycological effect of reducing the price to the customer  despite the overall cost being the same  as well as free marketing  on omato wiggy and even for dinein on ineout omato he 25 commission probably includes the charges of card payments  23  as well as the  on their services provided to you   hey charge you the customer a  35 to 25 rupee for the delivery per order omato is earning almost 100 ruppes from you and me  understand its a business you need profits but the discounts they are running will shut our favourite mall time businesses very soon am never charged above 20 usually ith wiggy delivery is free due to wiggy uper hen ordering food   do not account for delivery charges in wiggy  because they are discounting the delivery charges hey discount the delivery charges because they get the revenue from your commissions f the delivery charges are high   am not going to order at all  am ordering from restaurants 3040 minutes away from my home that would never deliver to my area    ocal restaurants in my area simply build up loyal customers and then stop offering discounts  know food stalls that are running for years due to omato wiggy omato wiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this o  they provide convenience to the customer that even big companies like conalds  izza ut   or ominos fail to provide  evelop your own app that is not crap  and support all payment methods  then ll consider moving off wiggy or omato earching for a restaurant  and clicking order  payment is set up already  takes less than 1 minute for me  ox8  ox8  ojo izza and other brands   aasos  aasos  irangi ake  venstory izza  weet ooth  ehrouz iryani   harcoal ats  harcoal iryani  hilli lakes izza  all have their own apps that work well and offer more discounts than omato wiggy  so  use their apps when ordering from them ut they also spend on marketing and  infrastructure  also run a restaurant nd m partnering with these guys to deliver food ut when  think  its a must for them to charge this rate of commission to run their business and still be profitable f a person orders 100 worth food  the delivery person gets to waste about 3045 mins of his time and travel few kilometres ho would do it for 2530 ustomers who order through these apps dont sit in your restaurant  dont consume time and effort of your servers  your air conditioning or water o if you have to pay a percentage to these apps which you save on overheads what exactly is unfair he problem is you want to make the same money whether its an online customer or an offline one hese apps help you scale your business and without them you can simply operate as you always have  but you know that would be a lost opportunity estaurants in my city already raise their rates on omato for every dish o business is booming for them instead of them going out of business ustomer has to pay more to get it delivered  and its fair  omato cancelled my order 30 minutes after ordering saying that the restaurant was closed  lost 100 rs worth coupon and they said that they would try delivering the next order quicker worst app for food delivery eriod an  this is wrong on so many levels ou can take them to court  just got out of law school ive me sometime  the least  can do is give you some preliminary legal advice hy are fast food burgers  pizza etc  prices the same in the  and in ndia  conalds burger in the  costs 3  and burgers here sometimes cost more than that  think you should stop whining ou are free to stop working with zomato and wiggy  you just prefer working with them because they bring you orders hat you described is not cheating by any stretch of imagination  its business,11

397,nyone else noticed the dip in quality of local restaurants after wiggy omato blew up https  wwwredditcom r india comments cm4btg anyone else noticed the dip in quality of local   hat may be true but did anyone notice quality of wiggy plummeting down ew delivery boys who dont even know how to use the app navigation and rude behaviour othing ever happens even if you complain so they just keep getting ruder every month ou regular the wrong places  guess he places  regular are still fine except that service takes a bit longer than usual as online orders get priority ut since  mostly am out with my family  do not mind  have a couple of places near me who do not take orders from swiggy  zomato they are good too  but take a similar time in serving gain the delay does not bug me  so alls good hey are getting paid 5060 bucks 30 commission + 3050 discount + returns  cancellation and scams  for a 200 rs tandoori chicken by the swamato due to the competition  fomo and monopoly in the market ude always remember that if you are eating out or ordering food you are eating extremely unhygienic food y friend who is now chef at third restaurant has seen some shit e never eats out o matter from where you order hit has got the fan since order delivery services came ecause customer is not even at restaurant to see if quality of kitchen is up to standard or not hat was just a one time experience for me heres a pizza outlet where  went to he times when  had food at their place  t was amazing hen  ordered through swiggy  it sucked badly ot sure about dining in  but  have definitively noticed a dip in quality in the food since zomato swiggy have become mainstreamarlier  all the curries used to have their unique flavor and taste ow it feels like they just have one big tub of curry and they just add the stuff youve ordered o mushroom masala tastes  the same as utter aneer masala  just with aneer instead of ushroom ven the most premium restaurant available on these platforms in my area has same tasting food whenever you order ts slowly getting so annoying that my lazy ass rather prefer to cook my food myself ooks like wiggy ber bullshit has hit both the restaurant business and the delivery business equally well 1  friend got his food delivered in a la carte style   wiggy delivery executive shows up  puts his hand into the cloth bag which the restaurant gave  proceeds to hand my friend the items that were in it and leaves with the cloth bag2 ber executive calls my friend  tells her that he cannot find her house because his    is not working he helps him navigate  and while at it  he runs out of petrol t this point  he is 200m away from her place e keeps saying random stuff and pretends as though he is not understanding where he is e refuses to ask the people passing by  for help t the end he abuses her and asks here to come to him to get the food ber refused to refund her the money  stating the reason as unable to contact the customer eah emember going to a unjabi restaurant in andra since 2007 isited there this year after a gap of four years and it has actually way worse off than before ood seemed hastily cooked and the waiters just literally wanted you the eat and gtfo and there was a line of delivery guys outside  deleted  he good restaurants  like dont do online delivery in the first place hat is true  reason behind is earlier  business was simple  the raw material and prepration cost was needed to be calculated with price to get an idea of decent profit  now swiggy etc take away nearly 28   off per order so they have to adjust the quality and quantity to maintain the same profit   ventually they apply same formula all across   asically what theyre doing is scrapping off the gone 28 from regular direct customers  so quality has been degraded all over  here  stay  good quality restaurants prefer to switch off wiggy omato etc whenever there is heavy load hey are just not listed on wiggy at that particular time hey prefer to serve their dinein customers firstlso  in situations like now the rainy season  wiggy gives the order to the restaurant  but is unable to find the delivery executive at the right time  leading to cancellation of orders due to very long delay times his causes a loss for everyone  have seen lots of conversations on restauranteur groups where the owners are cribbing about the tight corners caused by these services ave seen sizeable reduction in dining area in few of the hotels nearby here in angalore  restaurant near me has the opposite situation hen i ate the food there it felt more fresh compared to orders plus the quantity was more too  they were also offering discounts for dining there and takeoutshough this varies from restaurant to restaurant rue for a lot of places  ultiple factors to it 1 cale  arlier a restaurant was service a fixed number of meals at any given time depending on their seating and popularity of take aways ow the same kitchen is also service a much larger number of online orders  quality is going to take a hit with this increase in volume2 argins  with the delivery apps taking a large cut as commission the margins are lower  restaurants have to cut down costs to get similar profit3 ocus  arlier restaurant business was driven by ensuring customers come back because the ustomer base was smaller ood needs to be good  ambience need to be good  prices should be right  otherwise the customer is not coming back and you are losing business ith online deliveries driving a larger portion of revenue they dont care much lso  unlike dining out  which is an experience thing  ordering from home is more of a convenience thing ah dont think the quality has worsened noticably dont order a whole lot but the places  order from  used to frequent before  dont see a change in flavour or quality aybe its just the places  order and not a large sample size  had the same thought  estaurants are not giving a single fuck about the taste   theyre just selling food to fill the stomach o regards are given to the taste lso seen a major price hike in many places  local sandwich shop used to give a pizza sandwich for 50 ow its 120  guess the publicity from wiggy increased the demand to an extent that they found it necessary to hike their prices by over a 100 y place there is no swiggy but the restuarants are top class  have never ordered food via omato swiggy and i will never do heyre changing how you eat  outsourcing cooking ne of many perks of living in ndia is that food is cheap if you cook yourself ow this is gone too  now a big chunk of your paycheck is going into buying cooked food  cook my own food and ll continue to do this ccasionally i go eat out in a fancy restaurant because i like this experience hats it his ordering food lifestyle may suit mericans but itll certainly not suit ndians in the long run ake up,11
398,ndians whove been to other countries ow would you describe the taste of food at other places like taly  hina    etc id you have problems adjusting to their food or was it different but good https  wwwredditcom r india comments cec6vt indians whove been to other countries how would   rom my experience  can talk about talytalian food focuses on fresh and high quality ingredients  lot of dishes are created with few and relatively simple ingredients ome things that are commonly eaten alad with only olive oil and balsamic vinegar or even bread with olive oil and salt f you can do it with extra virgin olive oil  even betterhe food in general in taly is amazing where ever you go  every region has its own version of the same dish ou have to get used to it though t the beginning it might seem bland  but slowly you start tasting individual ingredients and it gets better thenndian restaurants here are not so good o every time  feel like eating something spicy  eat a pizza pasta with nduja  spicy pork  or just manage to cook something at home   ve been to exas he local food here is mostly exex or exican and it isnt really far off from ndian spicy food he other american food suggested by the people were mostly what you consider junk food here  pizza  burgers hen there are english breakfast stuff  bacon  sausage  pancakes etc n my two weeks there   did not go to any ndian restaurants or homes of any ndians and  didnt miss the ndian food at all n fact  it felt like  was in ndia but eating only restaurant food and non ndian cuisine      gain 2 weeks in ondon he breakfast options are the same as what you get here  but apart from that its all fish and chips very other english food item  except dessert   tried was plain bland ut ondon being a big city and all options available   tried other cuisines and so  could manage lso  pizza and burgers are readily available  didnt go to any ndian places though f  had to go to some small town where there arent any ndian sian exican restaurants  it wouldve been a struggle ish and chips would be available  but the fish is like boiled fish  lso  london is expensive as fuck ever going there again unless someone else pays my bills ecently ate ingaporean stuff like laksa along with some apanese stuffits tolerable but yeah your spice intake will be reduced compared to ndian ones ndonesian food is also very rich in spices ven the fried rice is excellent ry googling for asi udeg  gg alado  ate with peanut sauce  oto yam  kam akar ecap anis sually they also serve sambals  which are kind if like chutneys  but  like them more  stead of pappadums  they have krupuk  of which krupuk udang  shrimp crackers  is my favourite  good ang ung hitokaye or some capcay make good vegetables enerally  ndonesian food is great  but the dessert scene is still lacking compared to ndia ietnamese ho is something  truly enjoy t has all the delicacy of amen  with less salt and more lemongrass  liked it the moment  smelled it merican food was honestly a bit disappointing for me ost of it was just uncooked salad or grilled steaks  hamburgers etc or stuff like ac n heese which  dislike ood from ouisiana  especially ajun and reole dishes were very enjoyable though  suspect there is a lot left  havent experienced aribbean food is delicious  but a bit limited in range t can be just as spicy as ndian food  but it feels more wholesome erk chicken is a dream ood from outh merica  especially tacos and burritos and salsa were also to my taste  and they are very popular in the  uban food is great  wish our lentil curries tasted that good ritish food was disappointing ish n hips were ok at best enerally  found they dishes from the rest of urope was commonly found in the  ungarian oulash tasted good he rits are fairly good at baked desserts though  especially cakes and puddings ticky toffee pudding is good  dislike almost all hinese food  have tried save a few ichuan dishes  mainly apo ofu  wice cooked pork  meatballs  cooked duck and some dim sum onestly the smell itself is sometimes a problem aybe  as you ask  if  tried going to hina   might change my opinion  went to  an tried their foodts not  with spices like ours  can describe it as raw ost westerners eat their food raw he sweets are pretty good  f you go to the restaurants you will be surprised as you pay lot of money for little food t the end of the day theres nothing good as our own ndian style iving in  and been to taly  rance  elgium and etherlands ou get everything here  by everything  dont mean ndian  mean it taste wise f you open up to eating all sorts of meats  then you have ample choice of good spicy cuisines exican and hai food can surprise you with the kind of spices they used  they are super hot  n  ot is eekha not garam  taly hey know how to use spices  but not salt  if you add a little bit of salt to the dishes you are fine and  loved the food specially try their coastal food its umrance  only liked the bakery items  not that the food is bad  but ordering the right thing may take some efforts as they are not very friendly with nglish owever  must agree they use a very little to no exotic spices lant very blant food elgium gain since they have a heavy influence of rance  there food is similar but they have some good dishes which an ndian would love for the spices  again need to be open for many meat choices  etherlands ovely culture and food and you can easily love their food being from any part of the planet urgers  sandwiches and salads mainly but super tasty#x200 ll  would say is  open up to all the choices  food is food  nd there are passionate people making it  keep your beliefs aside and try it anada here is plenty of ndian food here  oronto has a huge ndian population and you will be easily accommodated ven in smaller cities  there are still plenty of mmigrants pretty much wherever you go an  get out of your comfort zone  presume you are still in your 20s his is the best time to move around nce you

401,ho do you think is right in #ogut campaign omato or estaurant owners https  wwwredditcom r india comments cuouln who do you think is right in logout campaign   hen omato old was introduced  participating restaurants were told it would be an exclusive platform for a select few to grow their footfall n about 6 months that changed and now any om  ick  arry can sign up hey also changed the rules for customers who signed up for unlimited unlocks  but are now limited to 1 a day midst this fiasco  theyve also increased the membership price of old by 50omato charges the merchant 20k per annum  and the customer 1 800 per annum in return for what or a separate list in the app and minor tweaks where you get a old logo o part of the kitty is given to the merchant  who is paying omato to join what used to be an exclusive club  and  giving away freebies one of the real scoundrels here thats getting away is wiggy wiggy has been running discount campaigns for several months in ndia under the moniker wiggy t he customer gets a 3060 discount on every order  for which the restaurant is charged a flat fee hat customers dont realise is that the flat fee is often times more than the discount that theyre receiving et me give you an example run a cloud kitchen that was offering a 20 discount on all orders with no max discount  aka discount cap  o if a customer ordered worth 1k  theyd receive a discount of s 200 and both parties were happy since the order value went up proportionately to the discounthen came their predatory swiggyit campaign  where my restaurant had to pay s 87 + tax for the customer to get a discount worth  upto  s 100 he tax is now being paid because wiggy has positioned the discount as a growth pack and restaurants are technically purchasing a product from wiggy for every order o 87 + 18  is about s 103 nd at the end of it  the customers discount is capped at s 100  and many times he doesnt even receive the full cap value of the discount because its a percentage of the order totalhe real clincher is that an order would have to be worth s 500 if the customer was to receive a discount of s 100 under our old promotion nstead  now the customer gets a lower discount and we get charged more for every single order than the customer will ever receive in discount valueh  and wiggy can claim the 18  in input tax credit whereas restaurants cantf you dont sign up for this discount campaign  you get pushed so far down in the listings that nobody will ever see you  seriously maiming visibility and discoverabilityor anyone defending omato or wiggy or berats   invite you to try running a restaurant n fact  try running even a delivery kitchen  which involves lesser startup costs  operational overheads  and is overall a leaner outfit ts not as easy as it looks from the outside f restros cant shy away from pricing a humble neebupani at 150  paratha at 100+  stand with zomato ood doesnt have a religion t is a business chemes like omato old were never going to be sustainable in a low trust society like ndia mazon is coming ois ho does omato old and nfinity and other things benefit     sers  iscounts ore food for lesser money     omato  oney from users  commission from the restaurants per order     estaurants  ore customers  but losses per customer per order     hat am  missing f nothing  theres no reason why estaurants should be on with zomato elated linkhttps  theprintin economy howzomatowentfromfoodindustryfairytaletoevilcorporation 279592  i remember posting a big post here almost everyone thought i was overreacting today how the tables have turned so lets analyze whats wrong 1  deep discounts of which the restaurant bares 3540 percent and the company the rest the problem is if you order worth 300 and give a discount of even 30 percent the restaurant pays 90 rupees and the company caps the discount at 90 so they didnt end up paying the rest of the percentage the customer would not care if he didnt get the 10 rupppes lesser since he already got 90 rupees off 2  no self delivery the company no longer allows self delivery the percentage charged for my outlet is 17 because i signed it a while ago today they dont wanna take on anyone for lesser than 30 percent per order  t least let us deliver our food so that our commissions can be less 3 zom gold  recently a friend took us to a pub and for 4 beers we payed 600 which is ridiculous had i bought it from the wine shop it would have cost me 500 how will you as a person run your pub on 100 rupees  im not mentioning the sign up fees etc 4  bad service  never in all these years did we face a problem of delivery boys eating the customers food  even when a order is cancelled i never receive  my food back  account managers not answering calls going on random vacations and the service center is just abysmal #x200 overall zomato needs to behave  personally think this is a healthy campaign he ood ggregator pps are still at a nascent stage nd we all know how startups can be aggressive for them to be to be successful o right now  they are probably bullying the restaurants nd now these restaurant associations have woken up and fighting back his is nothing but market forces at play oon  the market would mature and all the stakeholders would reach a point of understanding where everyone gets benefited hese are natural events in a free market and lets not paint someone bad or good here,11

seem to be the only one who isnt puzzled by how exactly will the population of cats increase when stray dogs are taken care of ts not like they have a direct competition for resources survival n a une  impri  apartment recently  a stray dog bit a little girls leg who soon died instantly on the spot he girls father started a campaign to remove stray dogs from the area and  dont think his is wrong uch incidents are becoming quite common in big cities but m yet to hear a stray cat attacking anyone yet irst of all  theres no proof that toxoplasmosis is a mind control disease  there are some studies going on which link toxoplasmosis to certain mental illnesses  but nothing has been proved yet  is mostly asymptotic  but can develop seriousl conditions in people with impaired immunity like   as you mentioned ikipedia says almost 50 of worlds population carry the parasite o  if indeed it was a mind controlling parasite  then we can very well conclude that the toxoplasmosis parasite is basically running the world#x200 econdly  removing dogs cats is never the option  the best method is population control by neutering spaying ut this is expensive and thats why municipal corporations are loathe to spend the money when they can just cull the animals  lot of people and s end up doing this out of their own pockets y girlfriend personally pays for neutering and treating all her neighborhood dogs  also raises funds in the college where she teaches to look after the dogs that reside in the college premises  sometimes help her out with this  and believe me it is not an easy job for common people to do ne of her college dogs had got distemper and had to be put down hen we had to go an disinfect the whole college premises and vaccinate every stray dog there ithout municipal help  the costs are often too exorbitant to do what we want to do ut still a lot of people try heres a guy we know who runs his own  to look after stray dogs e takes in any disable dogs he comes across and looks after them#x200 t the end of the day  just like humans all animals are unpredictable and can have fits of rage or mood swings  we need to respect all of them hen  was a child   used to be very scared of dogs   would try and avoid streets where  knew stray dogs loiter n my attempts to steer clear of them   often tried to run away and ended up being chased ut as  grew up   learned to treat them with respect as  would do a human  and as a result  have become more friendly towards them  and they towards me#x200  had a classmate long time back who was attacked by her own pet dog who had developed some kind of a disease er dog bit her in the face and left her disfigured for life  but this did not affect her love for animals at all he told me that she was still sad and cried after her pet dog was put down due to the disease  dont think stray dog population and stray cat population is related in that way  you seem to assume that they are negatively correlated  but like you said  dogs are more compassionate  they dont really kill much  certainly not stray cats which can be ferocious  removing stray dogs or not  there will be little impact on stray catsaving stray dog is indeed a problem  so is having stray cats  dont think of excuses to avoid solving a problem  like  cant say congested cities should not develop metro systems because constructing metro systems is costly and without metro systems people can also ride bikes which is a healthier lifestyle ust spay and neuter them  and let them be e can just sterlize dogs to control their population because frankly speaking their population is out of control and in the neighbourhood they bark at random people  sometimes even bite kids  etc so something needs to be done  deleted  s someone whos very

and toxic foods  exposure to the sun for long times lead to boils  or heat rashes #x200 ost of the foods recommended to cool down are meant to cool down or are less acidic  like yogurt  lassi and all in nature to balance diet yurveda is based on superficial observations and correlations n fact  there is no need to single out yurveda ll prescientific ethnomedicines are arbitrary raditional hinese edicine  nani  reek  are based on very basic  often wrong  observations nd our language has not been purged off some badly chosen terms either or example  the term boil hy is a skin boil called boil hese common sense terms hinder our understandingnd these systems did not know about the perception tricks played by brain int feels cold on the tongue because the molecules unlock receptors that are supposed to detect low temperature picy food feels hot and causes sweating because brain is fooled by capsaicin unlocking hightemperature receptorsome observations  however  still hold true even when their models were wrongor example  a shaman using some leaf paste along with elaborate rituals and dancing to cure malarial fever will be successful is model might be wrong but he will succeed nonetheless nly problem is the shaman cannot know which parts of his cure are worthless and which is the active part actually doing the treatmentr system which attributes disease like tuberculosis to a spirit and recommends quarantine will be right despite having a wrong model  spirit rather than microorganisms yurveda is the same ts based on a bad foundation aturally   pun unintended   it will have wrong diagnoses and wrong treatments nd it doesnt help that its not revised thanks to our taboo of updating ancient wisdom oodinduced thermogenesis ifferent foods have different calorific values

like other bullshits such as positive energy and negative energy ry beef and see the difference in your body temperature  its not about body heat but about how the foods make you feel  mostly in the gastrointestinal tract ating a lot spicy food has the opposite effect of eating a lot of curd rice for example and its not far fetched to associate those feelings with heat and cold respectively ther foods can be categorised in the same way ts yurveda ts bullshit anyway f its annoying you then why listen ust do whatever you like onest opinion  if  eat chicken or certain foods   do get constipated even though  ensure  have enough fiber  and limbs are heated have been informed it is that the nature of my body is heat and rather consume it in low amounts his is personal experienceor ex   require

eparatist violence  ashmir  unjab  orth ast  axalism  aoism  severe  real  food shortage  we used to depend on imported foodgrains before the green revolution made us selfsufficient  immense ignorance and illiteracy  we had 15 literacy in 1940s  and a paperthin govt ven as late as 2000s  we had endemic power shortage leading to long cuts even in summers hese problems were solved and now the country is selfsufficient in power generation  and most power sector issues are specific  economically ow were a 3 economy  with 75 literacy rate  600 billion dollars available for the central and state govts to spend in tax revenue  a growing economy  exact rate of which is disputed but 56 is a number we can agree onalf the issues you raised are trivial moot he rate at which water is wastedo an extent fixable  as our local bodies get their shit together hen on the brink of crisis  people find ways to solve problems he tanker mafia crisis in metros is actually a boon because it provides economic incentives for conservation  people are installing unitlevel o water meters in apartment buildings  recycling for flushing etc and so on he food might run out due to the surge in populationalderdash ur food production issues were solved during reen evolution o country with a  capita of 2000 and growing is starving  and is rich enough to import foodgrains if a massive catastrophe impacts production temporarily for a couple of years or every suicide you see in papers  there are 10 farmers making a living  not a luxurious living  sure  but can feed themselves and their familieshe surge in population bit is  ur population growth is slowing down   is down to 23 which is very close to the replacement rate f you can feed 13 today  you can handle 133 the next year and so on t 16 or so our population will stabilize  and well finally be at a stage where the number of people is not outstripping the amount of roads railways we buildorldwide  theres a glut of agricultural produce ir pollution due to unchecked emissionsvery country goes through a phase of unchecked industrial growth  which is contained as those issues hit crisis levels f you go back a hundred years youll read similar stories about hames or ienne eligious  racial and political issuese had bigger religious political racial issues 50 years back  and law enforcement was poorer  and people were less educated  handful of cases in backward districts are blown up by the 24x7 mediahe average indu might not be a fan of the average uslim  but he has no problems buying goods or services from him t leads to gentrification  but not religious violence remendously increasing pressure on metro citieses  our economic growth is very unequally distributed ou can leave your 20 job in angalore and get 5 offers in a week  but in a tier3 town youd be hard pressed to find a 3 job o an extent cities like une and yderabad are taking off  but its still too less overnment and government employees being their worst at their jobsnkillish handwaving here are plenty of problems with govt  but they are also facing everincreasing scrutiny  with public pressure to create complaint handling mechanisms  and expectations of timebound handling of complaints he situation is far better with central govt employees  and state govts could do a lot better  is that yes  well face hetherto unforeseen livability challenges over the next 15 years n this time frame  well also start transitioning to a clean energy economy  planned urban spaces  stronger pollution enforcement and so on ll problems are solvable as you become richer  and theres no indication that we wont continue on the path of economic growth  we might slip to 5 from 9  but the growth engine will keep on chugging alongdit thank you  kind anon  for the

once again aili fursat me nikalna h  have strong opinions on climate change  so please bear with me think climate change is going to disrupt everything in the next decade very week  there is some news about it e read it  feel helpless and move on with our lives hen turn around and blame it on the politicians and others ometimes we also act and make small changes in our lifestyle  stop using plastic bags  save water  etcowever  nobody really knows whats in store for us e get warnings every other week his is the hottest month  the civilization is ending in 2050  the insects all dying  the corals being bleached  food chain is collapsing  etc t some point  you just stop paying attention hat can we do  after all hese problems are so big and intractable  rightrong e can do something   plant trees  https  wwwlivesciencecom 65880plantingtreesfightsclimatechangehtml  rees are the only way we can save our planet e all fondly remember our childhood and trees played a central role in it  used to climb up the trees in my backyard and pluck the fruits  havent done that in decades here has our love for trees gonee need to rediscover our love for trees nly then can we save the planet  just need some way to get out of here ll become a taxi driver if thats what it takes es  it may not seem like it but things are actually getting better n the water front  our home in angalore had a borewell  just like everyone else   but with the adoption of rainwater harvesting and the arrival of averi water  we use the borewell a lot less than before eve noticed that the water table level has risen s more people adopt these measures  the water shortage will improven the traffic front  more public transport  like etro  is being adopted in more cities  nbelievably  ucknow has a metro now  verall  this will take years  maybe decades  to build out but it will definitely resolve some of the traffic issueslso  with good metro  highspeed rail etc in combination with village electrification and running water  the pressure to move to cities like angalore will reduce nd then as seccond and third tier cities like ysore or andya being to acquire modern amenities  some businesses will relocate there further reducing the pressure on the big citieslso  there was a research paper studying the impact of global warming on the ndian monsoon which found that it is going to result in the subcontinent getting 10 more rain  f youre surprised by this  dont be armer air can hold more moisture in it and the south west monsoon gets its moisture from the ndian cean  which is not going to run out of water  his is a huge amount of extra water which will actually be good for our country f course  the possibility of floods and cyclones increases with global warming  but as last years cyclone oni showed  these are manageable problems if competent people are in chargeow  all this will take decades to have an impact on your immediate situation  but in the long run  we are on the right path he most immediate problem is the water  while others will not make ndia uninhabitable in the short term he government needs to sort out the water crisis ome of the responses above highlighted most of the key issues  work as a researcher and practitioner in the area of urbanisation  specifically in the areas of mobility  water and sanitation and governance y reply therefore might not add any value or could be  terribly narrow and blinkered  so do bear with me ndian cities  like those in other parts of the developing world  are exploding in terms of their population growth rbanisation at this rate is unprecedented in human history  so even though we might know potential solutions  the scale that we need to cover is mindbogglingnfortunately  our governments do not have the financial or human resources to structure and order this process herefore  while we have good policies and legislations for the most part  governments are not in a position to enforce them ake the case of water supply in angalore umping water from a distance of 100 kms and an elevation of 300 metres   manages a world class system in bringing water to the doorsteps of angalore  spending tens of thousands of crores  owever  once it reaches the city  the horrible distribution network within the city means that lakhs of households are not connected to this network he old pipelines also cause leakage and leads to 45 of this water to be considered as wasted ixing the whole network would costs hundreds of thousands of crores  if we had the capacity to do it o we dont or politicians  theyve managed to bring water for residents  so they continue to get elected or bureaucrats  theyve acheieved the same  so they continue to work in the same manner  pushing for lowhanging fruits rather than engage in structural reform e citizens also contribute significantly to it  ignoring and avoiding any roadblocks that reduces our comfort e flout building norms  traffic rules and labor laws because we know the state doesnt have the capacity to enforce the law o whoever can afford to  digs borewells to ensure that they have a coping mechanism owever  even after knowing of water scarcity  we dont change our lifestyles to adapt to these new conditions e still want to wash our cars daily or leave the shower running because it suits us e dont want to install rainwater harvesting systems because we dont want to spend money ight now  society as a whole is continuing on its business as usual path he problem is that resources are running out and climate change will exacerbate all of our existing problems ater is going to be undoubtedly the largest ome studies have pointed out that by 2025  angalore would be unlivable due to the lack of water he situation is pretty much the same in most other parts of the country as a casual scan of the news for the past 34 months should confirm an this be reversed ossibly ut we dont seem to want to do it s time goes on  it becomes more and more harder and expensive to get there as well nfortunately  given the humungous inequality in our society  it means that the privileged will be able to access technology and government support to continue in the same fashion he poor will suffer e as a country are just managing to improve upon our modest baseline in making the lives of the citizen better  climate change will definitely push it back down ife expectancy and incomes will reduce for the poor  while expenses for healthcare will drastically increase hen peoples lives are not getting any better  social divisions tend to widen iolence as a whole might increase  especially in areas with little policing along the lines of gender  religion  region  caste and class owever  this is something that the tate and the political class like to manage control  so rather than an anarchic society  we may see an apathetic tate which condones violence he answer to issues like air pollution and water scarcity has been around for ages  weve only done what we could do to postpone dealing with the question or air pollution  its getting people off their vehicles and on to public transport eople reply  and legitimately so  that there is no public transport system overnments say that they dont have the money to buy buses  although they spend an order of magnitude more on building flyovers and expressways  which only incentivise people to use their vehicles more  t becomes just another vicious cycle nless all of us come back and take a serious look at the social contract that we have and our roles within it   think that were all screwed ater scarcity will be unbearable  heat and cold waves will kill off an increasing number and violence will possibly increase drastically ood production might remain stable  but given the changes in rainfall patterns and our agricultural style   might be being optimistic he tate will continue to function as it currently does  trying to make the best of a terrible hand ou and  and everyone else here will possibly continue to live a similar life ere the elites he above points are very much valid day by day the quality of life is degrading nly the rich are immune to this as they dont spend much time on the ground and usually are away ou are assuming that with a growing  ndia does not deal with its water  poverty  and pollution problems hat isnt going to happen e saw that as hina grew it dealt with its problems to the point that it has better infrastructure now than most estern countries t is a world leader in solar and electric vehicles and has taken drastic actions to cut smog levels in places like eijing ust look at what ndia has done in the last 10 years  brought over 250 million out of poverty uilt world class metro systems in elhi and is in the process of doing so in umbai and other cities uilt world class airports in the major cities and good airports in second and third tier cities ndia is greatly investing in railway infrastructure including building its first bullet train ts introduced domestically produced semi high speed trains and renovated many stations er capita income is doubling roughly ever 10 years he middle class is going to keep exploding s people enter the middle class they will have higher aspirations for everything from education to sanitation to transportation nd once there is a solid middle class politicians will have no choice but to be responsive o your sky is falling attitude is missing the point s another poster mentioned  within 15 years ndia should reach 20k  per capita     his is around the level of  member states like ulgaria or omania or other middle income countries such as alaysia  olombia  exico or rgentina hese are all livable places but not nearly as large as ndia hen ndia reaches that level it is going to be an enormous accomplishment and it will have incredible economic and geopolitical power as a result rent point 15 by outcome of point 6 s ndia actually livable today his is ridiculous fearmongering harat has a very bright future  we just need to stay at it eve accomplished so much in the last 15 years its insane to think otherwise ost orthern states are 0700+ in  minus ashmir outh ndia is doing fairly ok entral and  ndia lag behind a lot but will catch up e have the best airport and metro system in ew elhi ere building and investing in solid public transport and upgrading our railways and rights and labor reforms are expected any minute which will unlock a lot of capital to the middle class and make doing business much easier limate change uddy  hennai is facing a water crisis due to 1  terrible management of their water resources 2  pollution and 3  very little rainfall ur economic growth is good and we will have per capita income of 25 000  by 2050 ur national  is probably gonna be around 08000850 ot entirely 1st world tier but  enough that every haratiye citizen has a  decent life t depends on 2 factors1  o matter which  countries release carbondioxide  https  wwwvisualcapitalistcom alltheworldscarbonemissionsinonechart    ndia will suffer because of our location in the tropical latitudes ore than 80 of worlds electricity still comes from burning coal here is a lot of coal left in hina   and ndiaow will food crop production be affected by warming hile increasing carbondioxide might sound good for plants  how will our food crops fare under increasing heat trapped because of greenhouse gases such as 2 and watervapor 2   ndians born after 1961  https  enwikipediaorg wiki reen evolution#tart in ndia  owe their existence to food grown by feeding synthetic fertilizers to crops ndias population in 1961 was 438 million 900 million ndians were not supposed to be born o  in a way  we have been living on borrowed time ertilizers require methane which is a byproduct of crudeoil extraction ood is tightly dependent on oil here is a lot of oil left in the middleeast but we know how that story is going to gohe timeline of collapse is hard to predict ater problems are plaguing us now ut we are not experiencing collapse yet because we can still burn fossil energy to get water e can use diesel power to drill down 1000 feet and pump up ground water using electrical energy  produced mostly by burning coal  n the next decade  there will be more of the same e will drill down to 2000 feet to fetch water or this to continue  we need to keep importing more and more oil competing with  and hina predict that we will witness a great dieoff  in stages  before 2050 fter that  our population  with natural farming being top occupation  will be around 100 million ities will be deserted as food transportation and distribution  supported right now by fossilenergy  will cease eople will have to live in villages near to where food is produced asic mathematics saysyes onsider that ndias per capita  income is 8000 and growing at 6 per year n 15 years  it will be 20 000 per capita   which is about the same as exico  rgentina  etc  hose are definitely liveable countries opulation wise  ndia is already at 21   which is the replacement rate rom now on population will grow  but at a decreasing rate  peaking around 2050 and declining thereafter ost of ndias air pollution comes from old inefficient vehicles  which people cannot afford to replace his will be addressed by the increasing per capita income eople will be able to afford less polluting vehicles emoval of diesel subsidy will also helpndia is making great strides in solar power to add to thisater is a problem  but it can be solved by better transport facilities and desalination if needed he rest of what you mentioned  andir  etc is just insignificant noise hats like saying  is unlivable because of school shootings xcept 4 and 6  the others can be fixed orest man https  wwwyoutubecom watchvkqy1do  https  wwwyoutubecom watchvkqy1do  eah  we are fucked in the long run hats for sure if we dont do something about this e as human beings are always capable of extra ordinary feats e can overcome this 2 decades ago  it was very popular opinion that way ndia is making progress and how our five year plans are being implemented   ndia will be a developed country by year 2020 hough we have somewhat better facilities   health care and access to some of the luxuries like car  phone and air travel  muncipal water  we are still very far behind in self sustainability easons the way political parties ruled ndia in 80s  90s is via religion and communal gap e all assumed the education and rise in literacy will erase that gapontinuing   even today education hasnt brought much progress in the attitude of brainwashed general publicntil if majority of population vote for basic ammenities and  matured leadership as first priority  things will remain the sameoliticians did great job in brainwashing the most educated of the country as well  ecently  stumbled up on a post by a person with designation of corporate director stating  atel statue is good for regular public as lot of contractors and raw material suppliers benefits from the project iteranary   ittle did he agree that there are many pending irrigation and road rail  flyovers and they provide same source of income to builders and self sustaining here is no solution to this problem and emmigrating to other countries is the closest possible solution oure on the mark with regards to deteriorating conditions he single biggest hurdle is population which is too large to manage reasonably,11

closest school friends is   but  dont think hes on edditis entire family is very happy about the decision of course y ex gf was  but eh  we dont talk any more ot another opinion from a friend nswering as ashmiri andit    born in 1990  we lost our home  business  identity  culture  health and became refugee in our own country o amount of  compensation can make s to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community y generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered e dont know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of ashmir  dont know about others but  wont be able to ever go back ts not to the point and emotions get in the way etting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesnt change the fact we lost our heritage and culturelso he suggested you google irja tickoo and atish tickoo and read ur moon has blood clots  foresee the situation to worsen in ashmir while it will get better in ammu and adakh his will predominantly be because of separatists and other locals who might have been rendered slightly powerless here is a reason why  sent more armed forces into the states for my return  i can list out a few reasons why i do not want to return1 ighly volatile atmosphere with frequent disruptions due to militancy  army 2 ot many opportunities work wise3 resence of radical islamists and separatists in the valley makes me believe that its very easy for 1990 to repeat itself  here is a reason why extra army is present in ashmir at the moment4 sold off the only house we had in rinagar for peanuts after finally giving up the idea of returning ome of my cousins houses were burnt down or squatters simply moved in n short  there is no neighborhood  can think of returning to5 ounger cousins and the generation after has grown up outside of ashmir with only language or food binding them to ashmir o point thrusting them into this chaos our question #4 does not make sense at all ow can you quantify someones loss that too after 30 years eep in mind  people did not only lose house or property  but whole lives were uprooted he community has nearly lost its identity outside of  and will essentially be non existent with in next 50 100 years an you put a  figure on it am also not sure what reservations are you referring to in question #5 ashmiri here  however  under 30   will try to get someone to get your questions answered  asked someone who is ashmiri and above 30 years elow is  his view   think everyone has his view point ne has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions e still do not understand our position yet and what government of ndia has decided for us re we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us  he situation says wait and watch ma request ahul andita  was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and oung enough to say us his opinions eminde 1 day an we get anupam kher to do an ama m 26 and from the ashmiri andit community iven my age   agree that m not in the best position to answer s questions but  can take a stab if theyre still interested ut below are some general thoughts if anyones interestedy parents were forced to leave ashmir in 198990 and move to a place at the other end of the country where  grew up hey havent been back since  just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what its like about 15 years ago nd its sad and terrible ut  its possible to recognize the plight of ashmiri indus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that whats happening right now is upsetting  undemocratic and unconstitutional nfortunately  ndians  and the  community to a large degree  has been consumed by bloodlust and its fucking saddening hats worse  and  find bewildering  is how none from the  community were in support of repealing 370 until odi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in ashmir under the garb of patriotism and unification  perhaps m projecting too much malice on to their intentions when  should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda   dont think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this he most honest analysis is that historically  a lot of parties  including those suffering the most today  fucked up but no one took ownership then and now its just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the ndian government has been there ou expect tates to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way  its the common person whos affected the most nd  as things stand today  while the ashmiri indus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree  more than two generations of ashmiris who stayed in ashmir  primarily uslims and ikh  grew up in the worlds most militarized zone m extremely pessimistic about the situation  am quite certain that were living through the creation of another est ank here  am a ashmiri andit   turn 30 in a few months  know many ashmir andits over 30  including my parents  grandparents  aunts  uncles1  am of the opinion that ashmir will be violent in the short term xtremist violence is common in ashmir  why should this situation be any different2 e will never return to ashmir  outside of the occasional very short trip  have been to ashmir once in my life  despite my father begging me not to go  for my safety  had to see the place that haunts my entire family  at least once y father has been back once since the 1980s he handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off 3 ur ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile ur neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell  under threat of violence he bones still exist  but it was turned into a shopping mall e wont return because well never feel safe 4 y family was not provided housing by the government of ndia e were privileged enough to pay for our own housing any family members settled in the elhi area and have done well for themselves since ome family members  have moved to the   ubai  ingapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves  know that my family is not the kind of andit youre asking the question about  but it is true that the ashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of ashmir f course  those who are still refugees are different  but come on  ashmri andits who have a modicum of success arent moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment 5 es he reservation was an illintentioned policy that failed ashmiris and prevented the proper integration of ashmir with ndia am by no means a indu nationalist and  think the ndian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in ashmir as well as the plight of ashmiri andits  as does the akistini government  and ashmiri uslims rankly   think ashmiri andits are beside the point in this discussion  because ashmiri uslims succeeded in exterminating our culture ithout anchoring to the homeland  there arent enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry nonashmiris n a generation or two  ashmiri andits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldnt consider our plightolicy making should have considered our plight 30 years ago  but now its too late ithout internet and swarm of harat ke garam naujawan in reddit  think  can see if no one turns up n past perspective from ashmiris were not well received by virath

information about the future which is not also available to the professionalsll easy informed trading is done almost immediately by computers n example is stock  is at 10 here is new information which is clearly bullish ithin a second  the stock will be at 12 he new price reflects the new information ou cannot beat the computers at informed tradingew complex information about an asset has to be analysed and accepted by others for it to be tradeworthy ou can not hope to be a better analyst than professionals who have training  tools and access to insiders hat doesnt mean all analysts are right or in agreement  but only that their opinion is more informed than yours gain  you cannot hope to profit using analysis of complex information if the market doesnt agree with you eading a eeking lpha article  and the comments  is not analysisfter the information is priced in  any further price movement is driven by supplydemand and not by new information ou cannot guess at supplydemand t happens in real time and big traders fiercely protect the content of their future orders  laugh at people who buy   getting the information that ack orsey also bought some last week here may be a sentiment rally if others start buying  there may not be ou really dont knowharting is useful only in hindsight rior price volume action has no bearing on future price volume action ou say pivot points et us say  is reaching 23700 from above verybody says it is an important support hat does that mean ill it break that support or not f it breaks  will it go much lower  or bounce back up to reclaim the support gain  you dont know oday  broke and bounced off that support 3 or 4 times before definitively breaking down hich breakdown is definitive t is only clear in hindsightow  all the above should make it clear that  in essence  you are an uninformed trader  that is  you are trading blind hat means  charitably speaking  that your chances of the asset moving in a favorable direction are 5050ut still you will lose here are two reasons for this ne relates to the way trades happen  and other is about human psychology a  f you place a limit buy or limit sell  your order will only execute while the ticker is moving unfavorably to you   hat is  if the stock is moving down from your limit buy price  your buy order will execute nd if it is moving up beyond your limit sell price  your sell order will execute n each case  unless you are closing a trade   you are immediately at a loss as the price continues its movement  f the price is not moving much  you are immediately at a loss due to the bid ask spread  nd you likely bought because you thought it was a bargain and the recent past showed a downward price movement and you were bullish on it  ore often than not  price movement continues in the same direction  eversals are rare and hard to time his means  that b  ou immediately are in pain ou see a loss and will likely see it widening as the price movement continuesow you have many optionsi  ou can exit the trade at a loss ummerii  ou can execute another trade in the same direction to average your price his again suffers from the same problem he price is moving away from you while all your orders execute our new trade is as uninformed as the last oneiii  ou can hold the bag  hoping for a reversaloth in  ii  and  iii   you are now holding the baget us talk about thatsually  the price will continue to move while you see the red becoming redder ou regret the trade ou are stressed ou have averaged it 3  maybe 4 times already ou want to at least exit at breakevenherefore  as soon as the price reverses and it shows you a modest profit  you will itch to book the profit and relax ence  you will make the alltoocommon  but understandable  trader mistake of holding your losers and quitting your winners fter the trade shows some green  because you have experienced the red  you will be afraid that it will again go red ou will be wanting to not go through that pain againherefore you will usually see losers in your portfolio with a loss  of 20 or even 50  but you will never see that kind of profit  ver ou would have booked the profit at 2 or 5o whats the consequence ven assuming each trade has a 5050 chance of going your way  your losses will always be bigger than your winnersventually  you will curse trading and seek gainful employmentope it was helpful hat about if you use stop limits with market orders and trade into momentum his can work  some of the time  ow do you determine that the momentum is going to continue and not reverse soon after  ut the main problem is the stops  f you have a tight stop  volatility will take you out  f you have a wide stop  your loss will be wide too  iguring out a proper stop based on pivot points and past realized volatility is not that straightforward  but it can work if enough other people believe in your pivot point too still trade  but am a more humble trader after the experiences  t is possible to develop an edge  but it takes specialized skills and hard work  f you dont have a welldefined edge  you cannot hope to day trade for profit in the long term aar job milegi hen will you get a real job  deleted ,12

438,amaste  ndia ou might remember me from my m a akistani  here 7 months ago an we talk about war https  wwwredditcom r india comments av9i7f namaste india you might remember me from my im a   t warms my heart to see your kind messageeople from both counties need to not respond to hate with hate his doesnt mean that either side becomes a doormat efinitely not ut  find it sad to see people take pride in the attack or retaliation he loss of life is never something to take pride in or rejoice for think it is important for us ndians to keep in mind that the terrible attack was by terrorists and extremists and not every akistani hat most of the people of akistan condemn the act or this  it would help if akistanis could openly vocally condemn too t will really help matters if there is interaction between our communities  lot of the distrust is out of ignorance  out of just not knowing better t is understandable given our histories and excusable if it hasnt done genuine harm eople have been fed incorrect data on the other nation and nothing but more awareness  more truth can fix this ost importantly   would like to mention is that m ndian and we say dabba at home  did not go through the previous  so if it was acknowledged that some ndians do say dabba and dibba is just much more common then forgive me for bringing it up again dit  realize  havent asked a question here but  am looking to discuss ways to control the situation lso  did want to ask about how its portrayed by akistani news but someone already did  m scared  have no clue how any of this is going to play out   hope to god that this is just for the election and both sides will de escalate soon but m honestly worried  ight get draftedmaybe m paranoid  but were talking about a possible nuclear war hat scares me most is how ndians seem to be reacting to the new if the strikes  dont understand how people can be celebrating sending a missile into another country eah sure it was terror camps  but we shouldnt celebrate that e should do it with reluctance ar is the last refuge of the incompetent t shouldnt be worshipped  was talking to one of my friends last night and as she was going she said main sone chali neend mein thode akistani maarne hai  was shocked and offended so badly how someone so young   m 19 shes 18   can have some much hatred  get the anger that akistan might house terrorists and its a matter of concern for both of the countries ater on  ended up arguing and saying that people like her is why war comes into the pictureut  see so many people with so much hatred towards innocent people who just have no hatred towards our country t makes me feel sad m grateful there people like you who try to resolve and talk things rationally instead of going berserk and spreading hateve seen enough documentaries and talked to enough merican war veterans to know how bad and traumatic war is d never wish omething like this upon any of the countries just hope all of this ends soon and no more lives are lost hank you for your efforts eace  lections are coming  they will end and so will all the chaos day by day  am becoming a big fan of reddit in this time of tension its heartening to see a discussion happening rather than abusing each other  am not in  as its extremely toxic and in twitter also people are baying for each others blood war is a lose lose situation for both the countries  hope pakistani army will follow the geneva convention and send our brave pilot safe and sound and peace will prevail again hatever this is  this is made to look as an immediate response to a heinous attack on ndian soil through terror camps based out of akistan t is a show of power  and it is something that has deep political implications because the elections are coming he only big news is that munitions were actually dropped in another country ndian jets have crossed akistani airspace for a while now but it was for surveillance only  his show of force isnt going to do anything because in the end the  ilitary will be do what they have always done  send terrorists in with their blessings our governments have always been a puppet of the  he utter humiliation of 1971 is not something anyone in the military has forgotten  nor will they ever forget nd ashmir is just a playground for the proxy war and that is about it n the end  the citizens will suffer oth sides of the border nd jingoism will continue n the end let us all agree that mutton biriyani is the best  and veg biriyani should be nuked   removed  olitics  attacks etc may happen  but there is no need to hate a common akistani citizen staying in ahore or arachi who is busy minding his own job  know we have these issues hey need to be solved mutually ill then  you guys keep on producing music e are producing our movies ut of our hands really orons outnumber on both sides  elcome bhaiur leaders need sense  heres absolutely no need for people to die  ot ndian  not akistani  t the end of the day were all in this big messy world together  his is so unnecessaryes  love you guys toon ndian i  can you help me understand why some akistanis are upset due to indian army shooting down terrorist camp o civilian was harmed  no armyman was killed  so why the hate and  have to say this  ndia  akistan is temporary  hicken iryani is forever ets not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what weve been trying to createts because lections are coming his was the easiest and predicted way to cover up failure in governance ence this is the last refuge of any scoundrel who is in power itler did it  talin did it  addaffi and addam both did it to earn peoples misguided belief his can never happen in irst world countries  knowing fully well people are smarter than a 5th grader which both our countries lack and the bullshit will be called off regarding what caused it oth our governments are friends in the background and know each others tastebuds  but like any actors job they have to act like enemies for profitn the   both our countries ranks horribly in terms of basic human issues and aspects hats why this is what the government has to offer to us ell atriotism and to create that a bloody game of ate and arnage he lucky ones are those from both our countries are those people who quit and settled down in first world countries for better lives and they get to fuel hatred by means of spending money and few comments eanwhile they share drinks and bang chicks and laugh in those first world countries tell both of us how stupid we are to fall for thiss ndians always puts a poor man down under the ewage to clean and remove poop and toxics without protection nd we talk about injustice and revenge lease hy does your army have a chokehold over the civilian government ince last time we met loria eanss outlet came up dude o you live in a major city ave you tried imagining what a mushroom cloud will look like  live in arachi and was thinking of what it would look like and if  would see it in the distance before it hits me  dont want war  dont want people to die ut it seems inevitable now he nut cases have taken over the government and they will take us to war for their greed and pride aybe increased  tourism can help bring down the ignorance his next  one is never going to happen thanks to terrorism  but linent isa and property   land owning laws between the countries  his will decrease the partition hate because both countries feel something was taken away from them forever y 2 chwanis on why we hate each otherakistan rmy controls everything even elected govt  o maintain   justify this control they need masses in fear of attack from a  strong and evil enemy ndia  when ever we have a major festival or celebration or any happy time theres always an terrorist attack sometimes its busted sometimes they are successful  they chant llah hu akhbar while killing civilians and the organization which claims the attack is always based operating from inside akistan  oint blank  can ak  military establishment  or govt  live without ashmir f not then theres nothing to discuss  aks one point agenda has always been the piece of land  if they werent so dishonest about it the bloodshed of last 7 decades couldve been avoided ndia will not  cannot give up on ashmir  so thats the bottom lineastly good morning  evening  to you  in whichever part of the world you are atm  think you should educate all your fellow citizens to not support terrorism and vote for a government that  doesnt support terrorism   know many of you all are peace loving people   but you people should also take a stand against your government  removed ,12

properly   wasnt surprised how it went eople who are so used to scripted interviews can barely make good of s  am not a big tv watcher o far  thought rnab is that guy who just shouts on  but atleast he seems to be a guy with strong moral values and guts to speak his mindeading that   felt the complete opposite e came across like that soft spoken neighbour hood aunty that wont stop nagging  you until you eat her worlds best sambhar lso how she avoids every other question yet somehow manage to mention about her sambar in every line  as anyone compiled a list of the pearls of wisdom given to

to ask tough questions to people and very difficult to answer themhats clear from the answers of a person who made a career out of asking tough questions  u thatscoopquestion4 hour old account  posted  at the time of writing  3 soft  simple questions  rnab answered them all in succession m  being paranoid eemed like he hired someone off internshala to do the  on his behalf and just gave them the direction          man who claims to do hard hitting journalism cant handle straight questions   dont think he is quite sharp  e said to an answer that everyone shall be promilitary  that something you expect from an 19 year old who hasnt read much history or politics  like army as an institution but am i promilitary nopes that looks like a path to blindness to me    ringefest ust like ewshour was t was an enormous disappointment his  was billed as a big ticket event nded up being a damp squib udarshan ews ceo ka bhi ma karwa do lage haath oming soon on epublic   rave rnab goes and talks directly to the antinationals at r india epublic xclusive he  was pathetic retty much validates everything  though about him  guess somewhere irein guys would be jerking off to this  t was a total mess ts a fucking disgrace lso  the mods should differentiate between and  and an  ublicity s should be treated as advertisements  think rnab hates intellectuals because he probably wouldnt have a leg to stand on if he ever got scrutinized lso  did he passive aggressively threaten the former fan with the long questionee you soon he said ell hit he replies read less like an xfordeducated  supposed hardhitting journalist  and more like a rightwing  shill whos here to peddle his wares  feel cheated  most every question had the answer as a variation of this line e will launch  soon  cant wait to be back on tv e is the probably the most unethical mainstream journalist we have and he is going to get unrestricted editorial range in the new channel  e has his own definition of free of speech till spouting lies about the  students imesses foreign press and activists s ok with using human shields and a host of other morally indefensible beliefs   o matter how much this  will look like weve flanked him  no amount of adhominem he got is enough nce he gets cameras pointed at him  the kangaroo courts he will telecast live will do more damage to our sanity than r india can ever do ell be left in disbelief at a number of insane things hell spout and only be cleaning up after uck that guy   deleted  https  mimgurcom 1bhat is according to you the best  moment from  t least he answered mineut none of them were to the point  missing the point by a wide swath  guess it was a deliberate tactic to move away from anything that might affect his pro bjp leanings   ts a complete trainwreck  hope he lost a few viewers today  and that would be quite fitting  if he carries on with his channel with the same attitude f he changes  m all ears  hope theirein or others write about this poor  hat will trigger rnab riyanka hopra   rnab oswami  orse than  expected  he didnt even put on a facade of trying to have a sincere discussion ust publicized his channel and gave some flippant  responses to detailed questions  learly the esteemed journalist was here to promote the new republic channel ot roasted on eddit but  am afraid most of the people will fall for the prey outside reddit ven  thought his channel will be better ow  wont watch any shit from it  oora timewaste tha like his newshour     said that first  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 67h0uz announcement ama with arnab goswami on 27th april dgqf5sb   knew this good for nothing sneaky bastard will do as predicted he way the  looks right now  it is quite weird he critical questions  which have the highest number of upvotes  are nowhere close to the top he questions at the top are softballs  guess that ranking is getting manipulated by the  team as well   india never forgets  rnab shouldnt have done the    he will now become the door knob of r india   dvertisement kar gya bahen chod e cant shut mic here  oly shit felt sorry for this shit when  learned he was abruptly fired  but now after the   wish imes had decimated him ppalled by the below reply from a ournalist of his stature  want it to be debated   feel the army and paramilitary needs to be given greater powers in ashmiry view ppalled that it comes from a journalist o should there be a systemic eradication of seperatists or whom the rmy and the state think to be a threat here was only 7 turnout in the recently concluded byelections in  ets say these 7 are true nationalists  n this basis  would go ahead and assume based on past turnouts  20 would like to vote and would therefore want to be associated with ndia but because of fear they did not his still keeps out 73  ho you ir want to be killed  raped and be subjected to severe torcher because the state and the army thinks to be a threat to the sovernieghty of the country learly you have a bias even if you do not want to proclaim it out in the open  to make it easier to read sort by qa e was drunk  think here was no difference between vocab of onald rump and his  asked how will you expand republics coverage to global level  he answered we will use digital + technologyis other answers also were like they were being typed by trump acked any depth whatsoever hese statements he made here in written maybe didnt look as good as they wouldve on  coming out of his mouth filled with anger nyway this article in caravan mag correctly described he hates facts e runs his media empire all on emotions ll his statements like everyone needs to be pro india no amount of nationalism is enough in a person were an attempt to speak to our patriotic emotions ut he wasnt aware  it worked on times now for years but reddit isnt as gullible as an average imes ow viewersn his mind during  he must be like im nailing this  as m speaking in favour of our kulcha and kountry and army just as ahul andhi was feeling during his interview with arnab m nailing it as im speaking about women empowerment   and candidate selection e got the taste of his own medicine today cant believe people thought he was so rad and a fearless journalist e dint show a single quality of a journalist today ur reddit trolls are better than him on an average m happy about this   he must be feeling where he stands now  dont know if rnab ever looked at the r india community before agreeing to the  rom the questions to his responses  always knew it would probably end up like this elebrities come here expecting to simply have a chat with fans and face hardhitting questions they would never expect to answer in a public forumltimately as an  t wasnt much  doubt it will have a net effect in his channels visibility considering how niche this subreddit really is  how did we score someone like rnab for an  in the first place   u  dexter id you guys reach out to him and convince him or did he contact you he is a  desperate for any publicity  s it over  ye sab moh maya hai as that even him id he post any picture as a proof before the  y thoughts on this   ampart o uch hakti  rnab  we know you are lurking here and reading these comments  our  is how should you roast your guest in lower case letters  you dont need to raise your volume for it or a while i thought it was a oast rather than an  hen there will be riots in ndia  rnab  the asshole that he is  will demand answers from s who are helping in the relief processrom reading his answers  it is clear that man will support genocide  dictatorship and slavery  come what may  in the guise of pseudonationalism ucking cunt  guessed it would be bad but not this bad e avoided tough questions  barely answered in more that a couple of lines  and he actually said e need more nationalism  an we have ao for an  soon given his love for attention  his time he like one of the politicians in his show and randia is like rnub himselfo right questions answered but kinda completed        t was tatti hanghor tatti   called it  ndias ampart #rnabdodges his  shows that people have no honest motivation and be truthful and discuss ideas  both which go with them or against them eople think they are celebrity and should be put on a pedestal his in my opinion is what holds our country back ot enough honest discussion  obviously except on r india reedom for a reporter is in his mind https  wwwyoutubecom watchvxcdul28s dont think he was here to answer any questions   he was just looking for some cheap  for his channel but was bamboozled by r india    think his actual persona and media persona are two different things ut he knows what to sell as what matters these days is the bottomline  am reminded about this book now http  wwwsuporg img covers med large pid 23082jpghe main point is your nations  is more important than yours and people like rnab are using it that to the fullest  ooking at his answers  hes the polar opposite of what he appears to be on   m assuming that none of his team members had a role in the  ost of his views were downright atrociousreedom for a reporter is in his mindhere can never be enough nationalism ore the betterll ndians should be pro military and pro ndia f that makes us right wing  then so be iteah  bitch hat did we expect easonable discussion or answers from a  guy  uys you are taking this too seriouslyfor him reddit is just another site to advertise he does not take ama reddit as seriously as other people take or people here take probably the same way you dont care much what people say on  twitter emember this is a publicity  for his new channel launch more than an actual  aving said that  he is quite unabashed about his ideology and not really taking the bait most of the really good questions are asked in his replies and he is not looking at themven his answers to the controversial or hard hitting question are one line answers  love ndia kind of answers  you cant really argue with thatut he is standing his ground  you got to give him that hat the fuck  he answers didnt even read like it was rnab s his  personality that different  uking retarded  if someone else did it for him  wonder if he is going to have a discussion about this  on epublic  omehow he chose his questions  dont think  from arnab should be like that ts called sk me nything for a reason   he rnab ong

443,i  m wati  oounder of asharocom  sk e nything about ntrepreneurship  ashback model industry  more https  wwwredditcom r india comments 6rk5x5 hi im swati cofounder of cashkarocom ask me   his idea of coupons is still a thing people stay away from  atleast from third party sites   dont know about your site or how it works but according to the  announcement thread  people actually think this as a very non legit  even though it may be  how do you make people aware of the business model and its legitnesslso  the idea of all of this is okay  but its still gonna be very limited even at its peak  not sure but many entrepreneurs just grab the invested money  make bucks and leave since many if not all start ups dont have a money making model that can be incorporated  comments on thislastly how do you make money if tomorrow all of the retailers you take coupons from start handling out their own cash backs and make up a system similar to yours wouldnt it take your firm out on this ey wati  loving the attitude  you did walk in to an  which couldve been all guns on you  you did excellents a two time startup guy who managed to get acquired  fairly happy  both the times  touchwood  d like to know where do you see  going  possible exit by acquisition dditionally  what drives bigger business motifs for you  niche ecommerce or mass multi vendor  was also consulting one of the biggest coupons startups a few years back  and thought they would be far bigger now  but they couldnt innovate at the rate at which they should have  still one of the biggesthint hintelephant     lack of innovation and burning to build a quasi loyalty program does end up draining most of the money out of the system for some players in the similar space r ndia doing me a prod as well by maintaining decorum  his feels like a good  by reading all the answers o hows your normal day like wati  es   have read them oth mazon and lipkart are well aware of our business model we work with their teams directly and in fact they tell us about all their upcoming promotions in advance  even buy extra advertisement space hey dont like us giving ashback as real cash hence  you will see on asharo that we offer asharo ewards for mazon and lipkart shooping  these can be withdrawn as mazon lipkart ift ouchers rather than  transfer o there is no issue really they may not work with every ashback site but they do work with us in a legitimate manner https  cashkarocom stores flipkarthttps  cashkarocom stores amazon  in fact mazon informs us every month which categories are allowed for ashback  these change every month   otal staff strength hy should someone use asharo and not other ashback websites  ther websites have better  and similar offers   n a scale of  to  this is iger hroff  o you sell customer data snt cashback industry too dependent on online retailers hat if tomorrow lipkart and mazon starts to provide cashback directly to consumers like aytm o you think they dont already do so because it is not a profitable business practice n the  announcement there was a comment which suggested that asharo had not followed through on the rebate for the person ow often does this happen o you track this as the  hat are you doing to prevent itooking at your acebook page  the top 23 reviews are from former interns or current employees re you comfortable with what that insinuates about your business i swati   thanks for doing o you think little app is your competitor ts catching up these days in restaurant   saloon deals his turned out better than  thought ow do you compete against credit cards giving cashback  just purchased a phone on mazon and  bank gave me 2k as cash back  deleted  ittle late to the party ut heres my grievance  signed up in 2015  shopped for over 70k through

would like to know whether asharo has any plan to integrate bitcoin in the system n example application is https  purseio  but they dont work for ndian eommerce sites o  probably an untapped market

ood job  wati ll the bestdit  do have a few questions1 ould you tell us about your experience at oldman achs  2 hat competitive advantage does urgaon provide  n comparison with  lets say  engaluru 3 hats your favourite book   ave you ever thought about introducing a chrome extension which reminds people to purchase it through cashkaro whenever they are going to buy something from mazon or others ow did you get atan ata to invest in ashkaro hat are his views on the future of the firm ow did you get alari capital to invest in cashkaro ow long do you think a site like asharocom would survive o you think this is profitable f yes  what gives asharocom a competitive advantage ie how long would it take someone else to build a similar product like asharocom  myself want to be an ntrepreneur  what are the steps to get there ny shortcuts hat is your advice for young students  ouring ounds is similar to asharo  i  could you tell us about how you started the firm he setbacks and how you sustain it  hank you hats the plan with r ata on board new fundings or you gonna get him to do an ad for youo on a serious note whats the direction of the company now that ecommerce is consolidating  hat do you want to say to your customers about the future of ashkaro you still here whats your company turnover  can see why a 678  203 cashback  rewards  payment etc can get complicated  for average ndian customers  afterall the market is dominated by o orders or this business to go mainstream  things need to get simplified s you said most of the visits are from desktop users says what big chunk of customers youre missing out on  considering top ecommerces get most visitors from mobile platform n app should be the next big thing uggestions hen customers search for a product on your site instead of say on mazon  mazon would miss out on all the customer search data  which  think is very valuable  to mazon    how are you thinking of sharing search data about customers with retailers r will you try to monetize that data    ny plans of offering coupons for cryptocurrency   am a big proponent of the affiliate cashback system and have several questions ope you find the time to answer them elcome to eddit btw1 ho would you say is your fiercest competitor right now ve been a longtime user of oaisa although opashack seems to be giving the highest rates in the industry right now2 o you feel the need to differentiate in a saturated market would definitely consider asharo if it was  place on the internet for comprehensive and meticulously maintained coupon code page  apart from cashback  think rabon has the lead in that segment3 hy is there no cashback for eay4 s the 250 bucks minimum payout ideal if you want to drive adoption and retention  and  have 150 and 0 s minimum i wati ope  havent missed you hanks for doing the  he announcement post got very critical and your  has cleared many misconceptions  have never used any cashback sites before but will definitely have a look at asharo from now on   y question to you is  o you think people who have great academic background  op s and decent work ex  are less prone to failures compared to people jumping into startups right after colleges lso do you have any advice for new age entrepreneurs who feel almost every market niche is tapped and that new ideas products are a great disadvantage given the competition   hat tech stack is used for asharocom i  ow this model is different from ffiliated arketing  ey wati   dont have any questions but just want to thank you on a patient and positive  ood luck with ashkaro what advice would you give to an undergrad who wants to do something in agriculture sector robably a stupid question ut  by any chance  would    mazon etc charge more if we come through your website s opposed to the normal route of buying through them only instead ont you think that your business model has a very limited growth opportunity and lifespanour model is based on generating affiliate income from etailers like flipkart  etc and offering a cashback as incentive to the people whom you refer s you start to grow  dont you think that some of these retailers will think of bypassing you and start giving these offers directly to customershere is also the question of profitability n a competition market  traders hardly earn a 10 margin on   how much can they afford to give as affiliate commission n top of that  if you start giving cashbacks  there will hardly be anything left to keep for yourself e are talking about 10 of 10 of 10  really  often get bored at my workplace when given

 artaj is so morally upright  n the book he does take the occasional bribe   afta  the series doesnt  show that  ome petty corruption by policewalas is generally accepted without any judgement even in real life too  o why paint him so hite    this was great ill do it again sometime hank you reddit  ey u vmotwane   a personal question ho is your favourite character nd what makes him her your favourite hen and will the  of the show be out on music platforms  hello all great to be here ax ueller said that ythology is a disease of language hat human beings have a habit of creating ideas things and worshiping them as real things  reification s there no way to counter the power of these tribal tendencies re we stuck between religious symbols  on one hand and patriotic nationalistic symbols on the otherhat do you think about uval oah araris hypothesis in apiens that myths are necessary for large number of humans to cooperate artaj  acred  aitonde  ames o ikram  thank you for udaan its beautiful  have seen it many times and actually showed it to my parents they have now become your fans as well   he actor who was most likely to burst out laughing during a take in first episode gaitondes eyes are closed when he shots himself and they are open when sartaj looks at him againjust tell me is this thing intentionally done for the story or is it just a creative touch to depict his background voice2 din se sapne me bhi yehi doubt aa raha haijust clear kardo he scene where sas men hit aitondes home and he has to defend had a similar vibe to the scene in angs of asseypur as that intentional an you tell us the story of how itendra oshi got casted as atekar ello1 hy oyas characters look much younger than she actually should be acc to the timeline of this series ven aitonde  that marathi lady and also artajs mother shouldve looked a decade older than they did in the 2018 storyline2 hy the present arc was set in 2018 instead of last decade3 hats next an we expect any announcement regarding any upcoming webseries soon ave you ever seen pirated version of etflix shows arun  the show had some extremely creative cuss words ho comes up with them ow much of those are improvised unty as a character hardly had any redeeming quality to him unlike aitonde and yet he managed to be quite charismatic and a treat to watch ow did you guys pull that off  arun what went into changing the timeline of the book to present day umbai has changed so much since the book was written and so has technology what kind of impact did it have to the story in your opinion s aitonde run awli  hy did you guys decide on historic episode names rather than going for standard ones  lso  bit unrelated  but when can we expect havesh oshi sequel  f not awazuddin  who do you think wouldve done the same amount of justice to aitondes role as him  hat benchmark did you set to evaluate acred ames post season 1 ince it is a completely different medium for the both of you how do you judge how successful season 1 was ny other book that youve read know of that you would want to see adapted into an ndian web series  regardless of whether youre a part of it  hats the most legitimate criticism are you working towards improving in future seasons  love the portrayal of women in the series here are hardly any movies or  series which show such wide roles of women in a story e have a mother  a whore  a girlfriend  a god mother  a lover  a goddess  a  officer  a divorcee  an actress  a wife  a sister ach playing an important role in their life or of the men attached to them  believe the book has to be credited for it hy do you think we dont see this more often in ollywood or even ollywood inema    deleted  i irs ongratulations on your success od speed ince both of you have worked in making of a movie  how was it different from making a etflix series ow much did the fact  that there is no  to crap over your work  help you in expressing your artistic ideas  arun re you a full time writer now  iven the success of  r when is your next stand up tour planned for   ho came up with the idea of casting saif ali khan id you give the actors any tips about their characters before the shoot id you advise them to read the book or put their own spin on the origin material lease tell us a bit about the global response feedback that etflix would have received and may have given you specifically about the language ecause  have a feeling that the nglish audio and subtitles were not upto the mark ven the folks in orth ndia seems to have had issues understanding the umbaiya indi used ould we get both of your views on that please his is something  was thinking of when  watched the show ow did you expect the general public to react to the various sex scenes and nudity ghat show contained id you think you might have to answer to some random  which are filed in the different parts of the country lso  did you not consider the censor board threat  arun bhai  woh sab chhodo  ye batao ki ucknow kab aa rahe ho ey arun  which particular actor surprised you the most with their performance in terms of taking your writing to the next level just with their performance  character that either of you wish didnt have to die so soon purely because their future arc could have been really interesting to explore i  when oya reads the news of aitondes death on witter  the tweet below the news tweet is a real tweet from ovember 2013 but storys timeline is une  2018 o is that a random minor error or a reference to something  ink to the tweet  https  twittercom naveen status 403280901498368001s19  alcolm is one of the most intriguing characters in the show  hat made you cast uke enny as alcolm  e was awesome    i arun ikram  liked acred ames a lot and cannot wait for the next season y questions are hat were a few things in your vision that you could not pull off in eason 1  hat were some of the the constraints you faced while making  1 re you working on any other projects with etflix  would love to see this partnership continue egards  ey eyirst things first  kudos for the excellent work oved ituestion adhika pte says get the  list ets someone named harma hen says on the phone harma matlab rivedi owameplate outside rivedis residence and everywhere else says rivedi hen why and how is harma is on the list hy harma  rivedi he  is verified ow is working with etflix hat was the conversation in riters oom about atekars eath id you ever consider not killing him ow illing him helps the tory ouldnt you have used a lot more of him in future episodes hen will the music from cared ames going to get released especially the intro music o you think the story has enough fuel to make it through 4 seasons  loved rapped and thought it was more haunting then most of the horror movies in ollywood lso can you ask nurag to release the remixed song ere pairon main used in ukkabaaz since it was pretty  dope ello ikram and arun  loved the show as your creative process for the show different from directing writing a feature film hich one do you prefer  ey arun  ikram  ope you had lot of fun making acred ames he background music was amazing   have some doubts  problems with show but one basic question  have is this  an you please tell me the reason why artaj was not killed immediately after he was caught by ourads men hats the logic behind keeping artaj alive and ourad torturing him  hy is trivedi referred as sharma f babajis bodyguards only rescues gaitonde how does matthu survive those men  s he is in the opening scene  i  liked acred ames  especially how every element had a lot of thought behind it the here is this one thing which was baffling how realistic was the portrayal that aitonde didnt know ukkoo was a transgender  even after having sex for months id you expect the whole ajiv andhi backlash ow come rivedi and gaitonde were wearing the same kurta  still got goosebumps while watching chasing scene of daan  hanks for that movie aif in his recent interview with ajeev told that you  not direct the season 2  hy the fuck  f etflix brings in avid incher ames atkins and asks you to step down from director of  season 2   ould you do it ouls you trade it for one episode of lack irror  please dont do it for the world e love you ny recent ollywood film you loved s  have not read the book  is the story long enough to cover the four seasons plannedor me this series was right up to the level of reaking ad and am really excited for season 2 ey varun  which genre you feel you have not explored and would like to do it the future ow can one pitch a show to etflix udos on the awesome series guys ere r my questions  id u expect this level of positive receptionhats the timeframe youre targeting for the release of second season  ey  so when can we expect the esh ankat e ai promos for 2  ikram ve been watching your movies for quite some time  from daan  to ootera to acred ames ut frankly  had no picture to the name ave you started coming out more and giving interviews a lot more than earlier  r is it just the success of the show that has pulled you out of your closet   ho exactly was ubhadraantabais daughter ey guys  its great to see so many characters and actors getting their due appreciation lthough  think anta ai is an interesting character who deserves a better arc ish to see more of her in the upcoming seasons   really loved the design and references to mythology that you guys have on the show and the title titlecards  hose idea was to incorporate these elements in the show hey added a great new dimension which we rarely see in ndian shows id you think of casting ana atekar in the role of aitonde ersonally  felt awazuddins physique didnt match his stature  he character of njali athur is said to have been quite different from the book hy was the decision to make it a feminist kinda character made midst characters with very regionspecific characterisations  adhika ptes character had no notion of religion or upbringing in a specific geography  etc  eg artaj being a ardar  aitonde being a indu from aharashtra  as that an intentional characterisation of her  given that she was a  agent er role somehow seemed unchanged from ust tories to acred ames or arun   vidushak   ho do you rely on to proofread your writings  to find gaps if any  to suggest improvements i  could you please tell us about the casting  how were the actors decided and were there any compromised done aif li han did a great job imo hat made hantom venture into the horror genre and produce houl on etflix ikram  as a creator  how much of an impact did you think the background score have on the final product op 5 foreign movies nonnglish  youve watched o  did you write any sequence that had to be altered on screen because of volume intensity of cuss words  hats with the colour palate tone of the film as it your choice or its dictated by etflix  i ikram and arun rover   havent read the book but  think the character arc of artaj ingh is very similar to a real life filmmaker artaj witnesses that arulkar killed unaid even though he wasnt armed etc artaj gets angry and walks out of the hearing  since cant see injustice happening etc ut much later we see artaj becomes part of the system and gives the statement in favour of arulkar hus he empowers arulkar robably arulkar was aware that nothing will happen to him and everyone will favour him and hence committed the crime  no matter how honest any of his colleagues are  his is very similar to filmmaker who came to know that his partner a filmmaker  was involved in sexual harrasment  got angry  wanted to set things right but eventually favored his colleague and let him continue work  thus becoming part of the patriarchy system and ended up empowering his colleague urious to know if the arc was inspired by this real story  ill we get s on digital platforms for the series mart thinking on having ivine for aam 25  he is fire i ikram  want to know if that glass wall in aitondes hiding place was inspired from the glass wall of immys office in etter all aul  link https  imgurcom 96ii4pj   ey ikram  any of your favourite scenes that didnt make the final cut an you share anything about them  love ince illigans reaking ad and etter call aul   heard r otwane does too  pecially love how these two use some simple  recurring personal conflicts as the core without needing to add new conflicts every episode or seasonith the nuclear coming in m afraid season 2 might get even more over plotted  hope m wrong   should read the book for the answer  ny adjustments you guys plan to bring to the writing d be super curious to know hen do we expect the econd eason  ny tip from etfilx side   1 ow exactly are we hearing aitondes narrator voice after he has killed himself s all this exposition happening in artajs imagination r did aitonde have so much time on that phone call to tell him about all of this2 eally appreciated the fact that everybody spoke in their native languages ut  felt that principle was broken by having aitonde speak so little arathi as this deliberate f so  why ey ho was the most fun person on the setacred ames is a masterpiece  loved the show and would like to see more of artaj soon ello arun  ikram ere are my questions for the both of you1  admire your writing for its consistency and nuanced attention to detail  but  connect the most with the emotional depth and honestyy question is how do you choose where to draw the line in terms of emotional honesty  or at what point do you find it to be counterproductive  as far as character growth is concerned 2 as there been anything that youve pitched and etflix has protested r do you have full creative control over the show reetings hanks for doing this   or ikram  avourite memory working with nurag ashyap  or arun  hich movie has inspired you   gain thanks for doing this and absolutely loved acred ames heers  ome dialogues seemed directly derived from the stories behind the episode titles  was that a consciously done or is it just coincidencexample  npredditcom r sacred games comments 8xo7z6 appreciation correlating episode titles to   https  wwwredditcom r sacred games comments 8xo7z6 appreciation correlating episode titles to   hat did inspire the fake encounter subplot n one hand we see you guys launching so many talented actors  especially women  here with such a strong cinema and brilliant story  and on the other hand ollywood couldnt even manage or better spoiled a good story  sairat  just to launch some dumb ass star kids our take on this f course  am talking about your opinion on epotism in ollywood  ello to both the lovers of the art y question is for both of you o you had many of the parallels references  that are coming out now about particular scenes  in your mind right from the beginning he best one  saw was aitonde the young kid saying  pun ko naya dharam mangta tha to uddha going out in search of truth  and founding buddhism ey guys  loved the seriesainstream ollywood still seems to live in a dream world of rich kids facing limp conflicts ural ndia is shown as clean  colorful with its own set of cliche issues ny body who has traveled into even urban rural areas knows how dirty and grimy it ishe romanticization of shitty things in ndia  he pirit of umbai  has gone too far ur people always attend movies where everything is rosy and the fucked up things in our country are shown as memes unto themselves ovies in a lot of ways define culture and mainstream ollywood seems to not understand this hey think entertainment is innocent ny thoughts regarding thisn the endeavor of articulating our present state  how  were you able to pull off the veneer and not fall into the trap of glossing over the dirt in our society  but actually baring open for all to see the real side of ndia re you also writing or creating keeping in mind the dire need to articulate our society and get people to finally see the gaping holes in a rapidly decaying culturepologies if this comes off as rambling  but would love a  conversation around this ubhadra in one of the episodes speaks about the anpati festival and what it means to the people celebrating it t made so much sense and ajshri   believe took it to next level anted to know whose idea it was t was a brilliant monologue ey arun o questions  just a big thank you for writing asaan t is my favourite movie of all time  and ve lost count of how many times ve watched it nowhank you  arun  hens the next aisi taisi democracy show happening  ikramaditya otwane  thank you for daan and ootera thats all  ello ikram and arun love how mythology is used in the show hich chracter from ndian ythology so you find the most interesting and why n retrospect  what things would you change about eason 1 his is to both of you  ont say nothing  ikram  a lot of the outdoor night scenes used had a lot of obviously yellow lighting part from the obvious street lighting aesthetic was that a deliberate creative choice to set a particular tone hile  loved acred ames   found it disappointing that every time a female character gained any importance  she was killed off an we not have that future seasons hat was the overall budget of   ow does it compare to a typical ollywood movie  ey  also  was wondering n writing for the show  where did you look for inspiration hat films  stories  serials if any helped shape your idea for telling these stories   hy are you not directing season 2hy did anesh kill chota badariya i ikram  arun ere are the questions1any artists keep to themselves and their team so that their creative process is not diluted ou on the other hand are pretty much active on social media and also end up acknowledging reviews  fans  criticism oes the response help you change your process or would you rather stick to your conviction2ey arun  since you are back in the stand up  do we expect a special from you lso who are your favorite upcoming stand up comics from ndia  loved the series and its many layered narratives  hen can we expect the next season  i arun  ikram  xcellent job with the script and direction  wanted to know ho wrote the dialogues for the part nurag directed  1 an you talk about your inspirations for the visual look of the series  feel acred ames really embraced the dingy  3rd world tube light lighting prevalent in ndia 2 oes the director take  into consideration while planing the shots with  our favorite  show and movie i arun ill we any comments on recent ndian political history in the showay be between the period 19952015  was wondering why aitondes indi would have a orth ndian accent as opposed to having a strong arathi slant given his background and upbringing as it considered hich is your favourite  how other than acred ames i everyone  ikramaditya otwane and nurag ashyap aside  who would be your individual choices for directing the two segments nd can a director affect a tv series significantly given they have tight scripts to follow hagwan mein vishwas karte ho ow different or similar is your personal concept of god to the one portrayed in the series   hat precautions do you take while writing for the present ndian audience  reat work guys it was a liberating experience to have prolonged engagement with realistically portrayed fleshed out characters ever understood how people get so emotionally involved with a sports team they have no connection with untill  saw the quality product you have delivered and felt a little vicarious pride to be part of the context ad to say havent felt this patriotic in recent years  as there an option to cast anyone else apart from saif li khan as the main lead  hello    why are you not directing season 2  ny other book you would like to adapt nd why was the relationship with parulkar changed from the book hy was chota badariya killed ello ikram  since arun rovers razorsharp satirical commentary on religious fanaticism is exceptionally well  will we see him directing a few episodes in next season  f aitonde is dead  how is he narrating his storydit  word ave either of you been following fan theories that have going around ow was the experience of making the show with the knowledge that there is no  involved id you have any quality control from etflix side 1 what guidelines does netflix pass to directors for a series1 1 what are the must haves from netflix in the show or each episode i ig fan of you both ny chance you would collaborate on a comedy caper  eries or movie  lmost all the best  series or even movies are inspired from best selling novels oes that mean if you want to be a movie script writer  you should probably learn to be book writer arun defies this statement but is it true in general   fftopichat are your fav places to relax and enjoy the vibe hat about script screenplay set design etc  avourite umbai snack   hich disease is artaj suffering from  am really shocked to see adhika pte dead in the very 7th episode  ont you think her character should be little bit longer  arun  ikram i want boths perspective on it  ill you be including adil or ary in the next season ow has the international response been to the show   mean do you have some statistics like  of international viewers from etflix  top film mate cheers keep it up arun hat level of improvisation happened compared to the script nd comparing the two directors i question goes to both of you  aitonde is dead in the first episode then how is he narrating the story hen you guys have specially shown the build up of phone conversation between the two characters  think you could have find an other way out also hy did aitonde kill his mother hat did he actually think of his father hit  missed it why saif ali khan as a lead  are you going to reveal sartaj and meghas back story anytime soon s there any similarity between the character of aitonde and real life on hhota ajansa  awood pin off sartaj singh  arun  considering how youve always been an advocate of a gender equal society and been a feminist in general  and taking into account how big an impact hit movies and shows have on its watchers  do you think the use of expletives involving women could have been avoided id etflix impose any sort of restrictions on acred ames at a writing production stage like mazon rime ideo does hats the funniest meme  you have seen about the series hat is the most practical  sensible advice would you have for aspiring writers with no experience in film in this changing media landscape ey arun  a personal question ho is your favourite character nd what makes him her your favourite here is a character adil in the book  which was missing from eason 1   will that will character come in upcoming seasonnd what should we all expect that will come in season 2  which will help us fulfill our hunger for season 2 till it comes  oved the show  especially the way it was written t was great to see  the characters speak the way a regular person in their situation would  ut do you ever feel that the ever so creative ndian gaalis overshadow the content sometimes   i ir  ongratulations on the success of acred ames ill both of you also collaborate on daan2 hen can we expect it to hit theatres  as aif li han your first choice for artaj  also heard that aif was the only actor in the whole cast who has read the book o you think reading the book gives the advantage to portray the character ey guys   asked arun the same question last time  so  will spare him this time aroundo ikram  whats your writing process like  what kind of hours you put when working on a script  how much inspiration you take from your daily surroundings and conversations and whats the greatest screenplay ever written according to youlso no niceties for you guys creams katekars name ah  just kidding  you guys are awesome  making our movie industry save grace  keep up the great work ow were you guys able to keep up with both the aitondes and artajs narrative together as it already decided at the writing stage or was edited later as per the requirement of the episode re you guys planning to release sacred games oundtrack   lot of hardwork has gone into the making of the show ow much time did it take from cript writing to promotions in total to launch the show on etflix  oodluck for season 2 ake your time and make sure it at least as good as the first season or even better   hats your response to the courts verdict about you needing to be careful ill this affect the quality of the show in any way ey guys id you all have full creative independence regarding the story and all the scenes shot or were there any restrictions that etflix put on you or something that you guys thought this was too fartw enjoyed the show and cant wait for the next seasondit he slow creeping shots that setup most of the scenes were amazing  are those ode to your fav scenes in any movies if yes then what all ould love to work with this creative team e are at dire need to change the television content currently broadcasting all over ee  star  alaxy and universehe success of acred ames be the bedrock of the new age of ndian elevised ntertainmenthis script is pretty worked on and the scenes are beautifully portrayed udos to the team for the venemous show #sacredgames #ndiaevolution hat would you advice amateur screenplay writers who want to make a name for themselves in the future hen will etflix anounced season 2 or more accurately why hasnt etflix anounced season 2  fter the response youve received for the show   how mature do you think ndian audience has gotten over the years nd do you think at this pace  sacred games will be just an average show in the time to come  hy did gaitonde ended up buying a rolce royce instead of that red car  f someone got a good script how to pitch it to you guys were you satisfied with the line of dialogue delivered by gaitonde after cuckoos death where he says main bhagwan ke bhi upar hthat looked bit odd to me ows awazuddin iddiqui with nudity ikram your favourite lack irror episode orry but the hindi translation seemed a bit off for some crucial momentsike when artaj or atekar says    hindi captions are   hese dont carry the weight of the expression o you mind working on this ound the last episode confusing t didnt really clear anything for me  failed to understand so much in season finale opefully next season will clear whats going on ey guys  great work on acred ames hanks for the  have a different sorta question  as someone who consumes a lot of ndian movies and series  weve all fantasied about writing a better story screenplay than some of the crap we see  know its much harder to actually write a good story than to dream about it  but what would your advise be to someone who wants to write an original story screenplay ow should one get it out there once they are done s the best course of action to write a small story and shoot a budge short film r just submit stories to the studios directly his is assuming that a fulltime course like  irst raft  etc arent viable right now  ny of your regular  favourite  food or drink joints where  can find you    am currently reading the book after watching the  series  found that a lot of storylines have been changed or example uckoo is a very minor character in the book  artaj is not so honest among others hat was going in your mind when you started writing for the show hat motivated you to make some changes ne or two examples will be very helpful  just loved the show ant wait for the next season o here are my questions  1 as aif your first choice for artaj ingh 2 id you expect the ofors line to become  such a big controversy ow did you find ahul andhis response3 hy did you choose etflix over other online streaming platforms ow was the experience  ow much liberty were you given by ikram handra in visualising his book id you need approvals from him  he main villians every dialogue was very cringy  was it supposed to be so or you guys couldnt find someone else ey ikram  will havesh oshi uperhero end up saving the city from nuclear attack ou two have been in the industry for a long time now and might have watched many an artist such as yourself still struggling to make it  doesnt necessarily mean creating something as tight and amazing as  on a scale as large as etflix  but  hope you get the idea  s there anything that you did different from these people and would like to share it with young people who are looking forward to entering the industry and beginning their journey as artists  he fact that aitonde killed his mother has left me bewildered hy did he kill his mother  hat did he actually thought of his father  for me the best actors were parulkar katekar cuckoo nawajuddin hy is there no dubbing to other ndian languages o add amil arun  who wrote the arathi dialogues ome of those puns were really good  think aif li han aka atraj plays a very little role and its kind of biased to see his name appear first in the name of the actors awazuddin iddiquis name should have appeared first aif was awesome as a sardarji  can we expect sequel reat work on the show ant wait for season 2ow can more bold films and  shows be brought into mainstream media  ow should aspiring screenwriters  who think they can write a webseries like acred ames go about it ho should they approach s rivedi dead or alive daan is one of my fav movies of all time  watched it when i was in college  emotionally attached to it thanks for itwill you release the sacred games  ow could gaitonde crush the heads of both his mother and the man at the same time ey  arun and ikramaditya ongratulations on the series  enjoyed it  but it was more wonderful for me to see how much my parents and grandparents and so many of their friends enjoyed it too hat has the response felt like for you so far o you also find the show appealing so much to unexpected demographics because of the very specific picture of umbai it paints  s babaji planning a nuclear attack so that he could predict it and proclaime himself as a godman here some of the soundtrack in acred games similar to soundtracks of ame of hrones or am  the only one feeling so  arun  amra  athee or you  who will called out by the  first  cue your youtube comment banter   tellar work guys  have rewatched it twice already 1  feel the character of arjat is very lame e is very mediocre oesnt react on time when it is much needed and always ends up in a goofed up situation hy is it made like that2 ow many seasons can we expect for acred ames  am looking forward to the next one after the cliff hanger by the last episode hen can we expect second season s this verified by the mods of r india or anything 1 id the liberation from censorship actually overwhelm you like a small kid in a fair2 hat sort of treatment from ndian media were you expecting after the release ikram will you be completely involved in the second season lso have you guys already planned on how many seasons this show will go on for uge fan of the show ongratulations to the whole team  ey varun and vikram big fan of the show1y question is will you be loyal to the books written by the author for future seasons or take it another direction entirely 2re there any plans to bring more such content on netflix from your team specifically in the near future3ere there any  stars you approached before going for saif ali khan for the role of artajhanks for doing this   you guys deserve all the praise you are getting for this amazing show kudos  am curating an nline reasure unt themed on acred ames ould you like to check out the hunt and possibly collaborate to make the levels even more intriguing hat are the pros and cons of working on a series as compared to working on a movie project hat do you prefer and why hen will be season 2 in production ey ikram  ongratulations on the whole series  loved it atched it  twice and would soon go for a third round ave so many questions but chose 56 of them for here ow did you decide to switch between the two timelines  r was it specified pretty nicely in the book   osting other questions in further com,
ents  hats your favorite nglish  show of all time   question for both of you hich books are you reading now  as it liberating for you guys ecause you didnt have to deal censorship and all t felt realistic with the gaalis and the episodes with cuckoo and her sexuality  really feel this is a benchmark for the coming ndian  shows or movies i ikramaditya   have been following your career for a while and have seen some of your work  daan  ootera and acred ames   common theme has been that emerges is the internal conflict that all your protagonists seem to face  g anveer in ootera  aif in   ajat in daan  o you do this intentionally to provide layers to these characters or would you say its a fair representation of how humans really are ooking forward to seeing more of your work nd arun  your admaavat stand up piece on youtube has become my go to video when i feel stressed hank you for that  arun  what was it like adapting from an existing book ow was it different id it feel constrained at times ow did you pick the elements you wanted to add  delete or the underworld bits  did you take from existing writing on ombays underworld  ear r vidushak oure the best and ve been a fan since much before o  asaan   etcour clarity of thought is just astounding and  love how youre never ready to take a stand and never late to apologize or learn if youre wrongince  have to ask a question  ll ask what your favorite witter handles are  orry its just the first question that came to my mind   u vidushak  what do you enjoy more  working on your stand up routines or working on movies shows like assan  acred ames aw you a couple of times in umbai doing standup a few years ago  its always fun to watch you   ome general questions on writing1 hen you people write something original  do you first write in form of a story and then adapt it to a screenplay  or directly a screenplay2 hen you start writing  what is the thing you already have in your mind he total conflict the story gist r just like you start and try building the characters and situations with a blank mind3 hat is the difference in approach in writing an adapted screenplay  acred ames   ootera  to a completely original and fresh one  asaan  rapped hank you irst of ikram and arun  great great job you guys  has reached cult status hich new actor has impressed you the most  arun  when did you start writing and what things helped you at the eginning ow does the budget compare to say an ndian production ello everyone  my question is from arun ji  how youre feeling after the great success of the acred ames its kind of ndian o  ow is your experience to cowrite the story of not so successful ovel do you expected this much success of serial during writing it  for u vmotwane fter watching the final cut  did you feel that there was something that you could have directed better or with your own perspective in anurags story arc  irst of all thank you for taking a much needed step of creating a tv series which has all the elements of what a large audience always wanted have two questions hereirst  what is the reception to the show in the industry o you think the reception of the show with the audience would help move the money to this kind of content or is this genre still too niche for the industry to swivel towards itecond  how is it working with another director ere there parts where you  question for ikramaditya  and nurag ashyap where  had difference in opinion and how do you come to conclusion to itastly  thank you again for making this show  hope to see the third baap real soon ongratulations on picking up a worthy material and giving ndian audiences something new ut having read the book  think the treatment could have been better and  would like to get your opinion on this  feel a lack of connect with the characters  of course the major characters of aitonde and artaj have their backgrounds told so we understand their motives somewhat but what about ojo  athur  anta bai and of course arulkar sahab excellent actors all btw  guess if we could have had a concept like in the show orange is the new black where all such characters had a side track running along with the main track aking audiences through their past through which we could understand and relate lso a request  dont think  will come in the show but please please put him in one episode as a flashback or something  that guy has a potential for a tangent show all by himself  s the home minister trying to defend the attack or he is cooperating with the attackers hats your take on nepotism

461,i  m ari  ofounder of ickyourtrail   https  wwwredditcom r india comments a15d5x hi im hari cofounder of pickyourtrail ama   a stupid questionhow is your service better different from thomas cook  almeraurie  ow many times were you close to bankruptcy hen you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders aw your website and really liked the interface tried planning a uro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience1 m  right in saying that your website does not sell pre packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the preselected vendor options to customise their tour o essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings2 our website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that3  tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldnt do that4 f i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for thatsorry didnt find that info anywhere 1 hat was your toughest customer service experience2 hat about backpacking options when visiting a country or example  exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded3 hat are your views on legalizing marijuana in ndia ould it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings4 ets say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport ow do you handle such unforeseen circumstances  am very impressed with the website so  decided to see how it works and looked for ewzeland as an option nd next day onwards  am being called by your representative  received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email  ello s someone who has used this service   have had a mixed experience ts a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesnt seem to interest the individuale have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip hese could have been better  especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from  who was managing our trip  this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed  lso someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to  as this was post the vacation  would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving itnyways  my first international vacation was through you guys and  will always remember the good and the bad uggestion  mprove the collection of preset activities  hat is the motivation behind this project lso  how did you get your first paying customers  deleted   deleted  o you consider  leasecom  https  leasecom  as your competitors ny job openings  re you hiring for igital arketing id the  finish  removed  hat are the payment options o you support ational travel re you planning to in future ne thing that bugs me about travel agencies in general is that none of them are upfront about where they get their margins from f an agent tells me  up front  that this is the itemized bill for your itinerary  plus this is my x profit  d gladly pay up  if  can verify that the items in the bill match whatever  see on  bookingcom  https  bookingcom  or  hotelscom  https  hotelscom  or wherever if an agent doesnt reveal this   have no visibility on how much  and where  the travel agent is making his money  leading to the suspicion that  am being ripped off at every point nd if  have to constantly doublecheck his rates   might as well do the same thing myself and my family of 4 have made four international trips  two in sia  two in estern urope  over the last 9 years  and for the last uropean vacation we did all the research online booking visas ourselves t was an exhasting time consuming process  and  would have gladly paid extra for a trustworthy agent i ari   am m ow do you do ust checked the site and did some planning for trips that i have already done and your costs are pretty decent to be honest nly thing that i would like to ask is how do you handle situation where someone faces some issue with the hotel   where its your clients word against the hotel nd how will u arrange for a hotel in middle of night if the client does not wnat to stay and wants to change the hotel becuase of some valid reason his is most important becuase even  single ruined night will ruin the next few days of tge trip and also your repeat business i ari  congratulations on accomplishing this huge milestone  didnt know you guys were  old    y questions an you regale a story anecdote incident  from a customers perspective  on how smooth the said  customer experience is ow has your perspective on personalization and customer experience changed from day 0 till today hat plans for the future hat should  customers should be excited about ey his is the first time ve heard about the website ad a look and it looks quite neat ow much of your traffic pick from the available packages and how much is custom planshats an upcoming destination request that you get the most in the last year y question would be at what point after founding the company did you observe a huge influx of customers and also what you think caused that influx  ow far you can provide customized experience in travel  ou will be able to find a very less common interest between an adventure traveller and a honeymooner he thing that m not able to understand is  the interests  expectations of a traveller varies based on their purpose of travel   deleted ,12

ministers from disha telling that  the state can be a anufacturing hub but when it comes to walking the plank  they only focus on the software aspect of things nfosys  ipro  etc   lso  the whole mentality of people family  neighbours  shopkeepers is being more or less dismissive about those students kids who want to build something based on their subject nd the only time they build something is if it is a competition his drives up prices in the competitions projects seasons and shopkeepers take full advantage of this    es  ndia is the land of jugaad nd yes  we have s who produce

 ear r atpathy   irstly i must congratulate you for taking this bold step t is a much needed change in the mindset of politicians ow coming to my questions  1 s an industrialist my self   i get a strong feeling that the policies and the policy makers simply do not want the rimary revenue generating industries of rissa ie teel   ining   ower etc to grow he same can be seen in the current position of all these industries where they are just merely surviving to live another day hat do you have to say about the anti indutry sentiments in the state  2 he rissa ovt has big plans for infrastructural growth  oads  ural lectrification  water supplies  providing huge subsidies etc    now all the plans are welcomed by the citizens of rissa y only concern is how do you plan to fund all these schemes when the major revenue generating industries have been forced to shut down  and your tax collections in the form of ales ax   oyalties etc have hit an all time low3 nd lastly   when will the great leaders at hubaneshwar realise that all the projects have to be equally distributed all over rissa for a fair growth of the state and it is not just hubaneshwar ity that needs all the edical olleges   oad rojects   ngineering olleges   irports   tate of the rt us tands etc to name a few   hope while answering youll truly reflect and come out with an extensive plan to elevate the poor living standard of disha           ello   u tathagatasatpathy 1    ndia already produces a lot of food to sustain the population and also export at the same time ur problem is storage and distribution teel or concrete grain silos are probably the best and easiest way to store grains until distribution  gunny sacks promote moisture  which in turn attracts fungi and bacteria which spoils the grains or rodents which finish off the grainsrain silos are such an simple answer to a huge problem the ovt is facing in terms of storage  yet why hasnt there been any initiative to switch from gunny bags

justified to offer so many perks and allowances to s while most of the country still suffers from poverty ont you think some of the allowances should be reconsidered and brought down to a realistic amount r at least there should be a government body which ensures that these funds are actually used to serve people and not for personal use hat are your views on 3 printing tech  reprap 3 printers

please put the pitchforks aside and actually ask straightforward tough questions his is the need of the hour he world would be watching this  an we please go with some alternatives as a community so it helps drive home the point t was wrong for  to call this program nternet  its not nternet t was wrong that they said some internet is better than no internet t was wrong that it was exclusive for signed up participants only e got past that already ts not about eteutrality anymore 1 ssuming the platform is open to all  ero rating in principle is not wrong hat we allow to be zero rated is what matters e can have support forums  dev communities  documentation help faqs and such pages zero rated ot the main marketing site of the product or the core business website or a aa  its easy to make that call  all logged in pages goes off the zerorating or a hosted inpremises technology solution  it means marketing website is off zerorating acebooks main website will never make that cut hatsapp will never make that cut o does wikipedia ovt services that are informational will be allowed but service based ones will  be allowed2 econd option for  to get the next billion users online is to buy raw bandwidth for them so they can waste use it any which way they please hey can target specific parts of ndia  like rural areas and be benevolent about it ets not try to fool people with it is expensive eople who have dealt with s for bandwidth know exactly what they mean oing with onetrackmind of all zero rating is wrong or bad  its against eutralet will not help us get faster to nternet for all  with the right price attached  ear r aniels  ve highlighted my questions below in italics uestion 1 ow much money has been put into marketing your internetorg platform napp notifications  polls  windows and sponsored  posts count as marketing ow much of it was dedicated to the actual product development f acebook stands to make no profit from this venture  why has the company made the said investment in marketing and development uestion 2 f  big if  the motive was 100 charity  what other ways were considered as worthy of charity xample icrosofts former  launched the ill  elinda ates foundation to deal with issues in the developing world hy would uck and other stakeholders not just do the same o you really think a farmer in aharashtra can benefit more from joining acebook groups than having access to highyielding crop  equipment  and infrastructure uestion 3 hat are your plans for making sure that the next billion internet users dont fall prey to the same mistakes that the first billion did re there landing pages dedicated to educating them against common internet frauds and timewasters hats to say that they wont just end up sending a bunch of frandsheep requests to women and killing each other over online arguments e both know thats happened many times in the past  and the fact that youre planning to introduce a largely uninitiated audience to this platform greatly increases such risks y how much has acebook beefed up its moderation team to deal with foreseeable cases of severe online harassmentuestion 4 lease take a few minutes to  watch this video  https  wwwyoutubecom watchvs0  and respond to concerns raised therein ooking forward to your side of the story on why  was omitted lease feel free to respond to other critical points mentioned in that video tooeedback our marketing for internetorg has been atrocious alling people who do not subscribe to your world view lobbyists is akin to vilifying everyone who disagrees with you hats how children argue he whole overaggressive  dare  say immature  marketing push has raised more eyebrows than eyeballs  appreciate your attention lease take the time to do an  for more than an hour his is a complicated and critical conversation  arbitrary limitations on communication will harm both our s fter all  having more and better communication is the point of the nternet  org or otherwise   look forward to an extended  insightful conversation with you and the eddit ndia communityhanks again s there any mechanism by which the mods can restrict this  to only those members whose handles are at least a week old nowing acebook and the crap they pull  they are not above brigading the thread aybe we should accidentally call some international net neutrality activists in this  h boy ayum ow thats unexpected hrowing himself  and his  team  into randians natural environment heyve got courage at the very least   ay  bring my gandassa please  his is a huge one e all need to ask the right questions  and not indulge in shitpostery xpecting new accounts to pop out of nowhere for the  ont be surprised if most questions go unanswered ime to post some serious tough questions f they are able to get this  right  even by applying sneaky tactics  like creating fake accounts and posting questions themselves   this would be big news  and they will go all their way to declare how ree asics was challenged but it stood its way by not opposing et eutrality his must not happenet ready andians  this is our chance to question the wrong  and prove the people that we can produce more than just dank memesivyashakti aapke sath rahe  lot of questions have already been posited  and it seems acebook has some form of prepared response for all these questions think there is a way to clear up the confusion f  could post my question on this   this is what  would ask  ould acebook let the users decide what count as ree asicshey could have gone with 1 month of open free internet for everyone  then the users would have to pick  say  40 apps that they can access for free from that point onhis helps connect people too  without letting acebook gain much from it hat is  if connecting people is their only motto s fb letting users to define and customize the websites platforms included in free basicshat shuld be included in free basics should be chosen by users not facebook f fb decides what are free basics then its not #freebasics  its #freeusiness  hris has a  in echanical ngineering from uke niversity and an  from uke niversity  he uqua chool of usiness hris  heads up ost comments on

beyond the usual rehearsed  response and gives some real answers ont downvote me for this  but one of the points ree asics claims in the newspaper ad is that anybody can join the app and there are over 800 developers who have joined their program already because of this his takes the tooth out of the claim that ree asics is hurting new startups from sprouting up nd  am sure  this is the line hris aniels is going to use tomorrow to support net neutrality  ree asicshats the truth behind this claim from acebook an someone answer this   he uqua chool of usinesshought you were trolling there for a minute hanks  u kunal and  u wordswithmagic uggested questions xcuse overlaps with others1 hy not come clean with your business plan re ree asics o one begrudges anyone making money aking fools  is another matter2 f your platform really is open to all  then why is it that only eliance that has signed up so far hats cooking3 ho is  iketacebook and why should we take an anonymous person claiming to be a  of some sort on witter seriously hy should we even entertain him s he a policy guy4 hat do you think would have been the fate of acebook had there been a ree asics sort of thing going at the time laborate with hypothesis5 astly  why is the entire ree asics campaign so patronising e careful people acebook is bound to pull some shady shit  including vote manipulation enuinely curious to know his response here   hoaaa  okay ve set a reminder his is epic  his is really good  everyone will be able to get a look at both sides of the argument which will help them make an informed decision  ou say there wont be any ads  and that it would be available for free for any developers  find it extremely hard to believe this would continue foreverou have every right to  later change your policy  put ads on free basic websites  and pull out your competitors from free basics  simple as thatpen internet is crucial  specially for a developing economy like ndia      his was desperately needed   hose looking to understand the et eutrality concerns around ree asics can look at this post and ask questions from it  https  npredditcom r india comments 3l9y7t net neutrality supporters are not depriving the    hy not collaborate with oogle which is a leader in this sector i hris  please answer any or as many you cano you feel acebook is misusing its position by all the advertisements and putting links in peoples notifications for supporting their own cause f an independent company who pays for ads on acebook wants to do the same  would it allow that f o  hy doesnt acebook hold itself to the same standards f es  eally oud allow organisations to put notifications in our stream for ad revenueo you think if acebook was launched in a world with ypace offering zero rating  would acebook be as successful as it is todayhats your opinion on writing government policy which allows zero rating from different providers o you see the nternet as we know being segregated into different network groups for the next 1 billion people you want to connect  is this how you envision the future so is this going to held in  r india or  r m   et he is going to pick and choose

having me  and for participating during what for many is a holiday weekend  his is the first  ve done  so bear with me a bit  t acebook  we have a saying that feedback is a gift  and ree asics has been on the receiving end of many gifts this year    eve made a bunch of changes to the program to do our best to earnestly address the feedback  but we havent communicated everything weve done well so a lot of misconceptions are still out there  m thankful for the opportunity to be able to answer questions and am happy to keep the dialogue going his is going to be interesting m pretty skeptic on how this will turn out to be http  iimgurcom noh1gifv  removed  uys  know we love logic and mature reasoning in randia  but please be mindful of the fact that logic and reason is not what acebook is

let me slide in some pro tips too1 he most difficult thing for first timers is to get in  especially when you see family members or relatives at the entrance he best thing to do now is to put your phone on flight mode and start talking on the phone while walking towards the entrance y usual conversation would be to an imaginary friend who is also coming to the party and is getting late ake pauses  smile  as him his location etc etc 99 times out of 100 no one will bother you2 here have been weddings where  reached at 8 and they didnt start the food till 9 ont be an asshole who keeps eating every starter in a thin crowd at like a gentleman e specific in requests e picky  rich people are picky  sk for nothing less than lack og or hivas egal  at the bar  or lenders ride if it is a gareeb shadi of people pretending to be rich how the waiter you belong est course of action is to take some thing and peacefully sit where all the aunties are and enjoy the performance on the stage  if there is any  till the food starts  ll this was for 5 star hotel  farm house wedding crashes  3 e dapper f you think your clothing is just good enough  youll not be so confident e the best ot just
